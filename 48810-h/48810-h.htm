Marines in the Battle for Wake Island</h2>

<p class="p0 in0" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><i>by Robert J. Cressman</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is Monday, 8 December
1941. On Wake Island,
a tiny sprung
paper-clip in the Pacific
between Hawaii and
Guam, Marines of the 1st Defense
Battalion are starting another day of
the backbreaking war preparations
that have gone on for weeks. Out in
the triangular lagoon formed by the
islets of Peale, Wake, and Wilkes, the
huge silver Pan American Airways
<i>Philippine Clipper</i> flying boat roars
off the water bound for Guam. The
trans-Pacific flight will not be completed.</p>

<p>Word of war comes around 0700.
Captain Henry S. Wilson, Army Signal
Corps, on the island to support
the flight ferry of B-17 Flying Fortresses
from Hawaii to the Philippines,
half runs, half walks toward
the tent of Major James P.&nbsp;S. Devereux,
commander of the battalion’s
Wake Detachment. Captain Wilson
reports that Hickam Field in Hawaii
has been raided.</p>

<p>Devereux immediately orders a
“Call to Arms.” He quickly assembles
his officers, tells them that war has
come, that the Japanese have attacked
Oahu, and that Wake “could
expect the same thing in a very short
time.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the senior officer on
the atoll, Commander Winfred S.
Cunningham, Officer in Charge,
Naval Activities, Wake, learned of
the Japanese surprise attack as he
was leaving the mess hall at the contractors’
cantonment (Camp 2) on the
northern leg of Wake. He ordered the
defense battalion to battle stations,
but allowed the civilians to go on
with their work, figuring that their
duties at sites around the atoll
provided good dispersion. He then
contacted John B. Cooke, PanAm’s
airport manager and requested that
he recall the <i>Philippine Clipper</i>.
Cooke sent the prearranged code telling
John H. Hamilton, the captain of
the Martin 130 flying boat, of the
outbreak of war.</p>

<p>Marines from Camp 1, on the
southern leg of Wake, were soon embarked
in trucks and moving to their
stations on Wake, Wilkes, and Peale
islets. Marine Gunner Harold C.
Borth and Sergeant James W. Hall
climbed to the top of the camp’s water
tower and manned the observation
post there. In those early days radar
was new and not even set up on
Wake, so early warning was dependent
on keen eyesight. Hearing might
have contributed elsewhere, but on
the atoll the thunder of nearby surf
masked the sound of aircraft engines
until they were nearly overhead. Marine
Gunner John Hamas, the Wake
Detachment’s munitions officer, unpacked
Browning automatic rifles,
Springfield ’03 rifles, and ammunition
for issue to the civilians who had
volunteered for combat duty. That
task completed, Hamas and a working
party picked up 75 cases of hand
grenades for delivery around the islets.
Soon thereafter, other civilians
attached themselves to Marine Fighting
Squadron (VMF) 211, which had
been on Wake since 4 December.</p>

<p>Offshore, neither <i>Triton</i> (SS 201)
nor <i>Tambor</i> (SS 198), submarines
that had been patrolling offshore
since 25 November, knew of developments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
on Wake or Oahu. They both
had been submerged when word was
passed and thus out of radio communication
with Pearl Harbor. The
transport <i>William Ward Burrows</i>
(AP 6), which had left Oahu bound
for Wake on 27 November, learned
of the Japanese attack on Pearl while
she was still 425 miles from her destination.
She was rerouted to Johnston
Island.</p>

<p>Major Paul A. Putnam, VMF-211’s
commanding officer, and Second
Lieutenant Henry G. Webb had conducted
the dawn aerial patrol and
landed by the time the squadron’s
radiomen, over at Wake’s airfield,
had picked up word of an attack on
Pearl Harbor. Putnam immediately
sent a runner to tell his executive
officer, Captain Henry T. Elrod, to
disperse planes and men and keep all
aircraft ready for flight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, work began on dugout
plane shelters. Putnam placed
VMF-211 on a war footing immediately;
two two-plane sections then
took off on patrol. Captain Elrod and
Second Lieutenant Carl R. Davidson
flew north, Second Lieutenant John
F. Kinney and Technical Sergeant
William J. Hamilton flew to the
south-southwest at 13,000 feet. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
sections were to remain in the immediate
vicinity of the island.</p>

<p>The <i>Philippine Clipper</i>, meanwhile,
had wheeled about upon
receipt of word of war and returned
to the lagoon it had departed 20
minutes earlier. Cunningham immediately
requested Captain Hamilton
to carry out a scouting flight. The
<i>Clipper</i> was unloaded and refueled
with sufficient gasoline in addition
to the standard reserve for both the
patrol flight and a flight to Midway.
Cunningham, an experienced aviator,
laid out a plan, giving the flying boat
a two-plane escort. Hamilton then
telephoned Putnam and concluded
the arrangements for the search.
Take-off time was 1300.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after receiving word of
hostilities, Battery B’s First Lieutenant
Woodrow W. Kessler and his men
had loaded a truck with equipment
and small arms ammunition and
moved out to their 5-inch guns. At
0710, Kessler began distributing gear,
and soon thereafter established a sentry
post on Toki Point at the northernmost
tip of Peale. Thirty 5-inch
rounds went into the ready-use boxes
near the guns. At 0800, he reported
his battery ready for action.</p>

<p>General quarters called Captain
Bryghte D. “Dan” Godbold’s men of
Battery D to their stations down the
coast from Battery B at 0700, and
they moved out to their position by
truck, reporting “manned and ready”
within a half hour. The lack of men,
however, prevented Godbold from
having more than three of his 3-inch
guns in operation. Within another
hour and a half, each gun had 50
rounds ready for firing. At 1000,
Godbold received orders to keep one
gun, the director, the heightfinder
(the only one at Wake Island for the
three batteries), and the power plant
manned at all times. After making
those arrangements, Godbold put the
remainder of his men to work improving
the battery position.</p>

<p>While the atoll’s defenders prepared
for war, Japanese bombers
droned toward them. At 0710 on 8
December, 34 Mitsubishi G3M2 Type
96 land attack planes (Nells) of the
<i>Chitose Air Group</i> had lifted off
from the airstrip at Roi in the Marshalls.
Shortly before noon, those 34
Nells came in on Wake at 13,000 feet.
Clouds cloaked their approach and
the pounding surf drowned out the
noise of their engines as they
dropped down to 1,500 feet and
roared in from the sea. Lookouts
sounded the alarms as they spotted
the twin-engined, twin-tailed bombers
a few hundred yards off the
atoll’s south shore, emerging from a
dense bank of clouds. At Battery E,
First Lieutenant Lewis telephoned
Major Devereux’s command post to
inform him of the approaching
planes.</p>

<p>Although Putnam was rushing
work on the six bunkers being built
along the seaward side of the runway,
he knew none of them would be
ready before 1400. He also knew that
moving the eight F4F Wildcats from
their parking area would risk damage
to the planes and obstruction of the
runway if the planes were in fact
damaged. Since any damage might
have meant the loss of a plane&mdash;Wake
possessed virtually no spare
parts&mdash;Putnam decided to delay
moving the Wildcats and the materiel
until suitable places existed to protect
them.</p>

<p>No foxholes had been dug near the
field, but the rough ground nearby
offered natural cover to those who
reached it. Putnam hoped that his
men would obtain good cover if an
attack came. The movement of gasoline,
bombs, and ammunition; the installation
of electrical lines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
generators; and the relocation of radio
facilities kept all hands busily
engaged.</p>

<p>The attack found Second Lieutenant
Robert “J” Conderman and
First Lieutenant George A. Graves in
the ready tent, going over last minute
instructions concerning their escort
of the <i>Philippine Clipper</i>. When the
alarm sounded, both pilots, already
in flight gear, sprinted for their Wildcats.
Graves managed to reach one
F4F, but a direct hit demolished it in
a ball of flame as he was climbing
into the cockpit, killing him instantly.
Strafers’ bullets cut down Conderman
as he tried to reach his plane,
and as he lay on the ground a bomb
hit the waiting Wildcat and blew it
up, pinning him beneath the wreckage.
He called to Corporal Robert E.
L. Page to help him, but stopped
when he heard another man crying
for help. He directed Page to help the
other man first. Strafing attacks
killed Second Lieutenant Frank J.
Holden as he raced for cover. Bullets
and fragments wounded Second
Lieutenant Webb.</p>

<p>Marine Gunner Hamas, who still
had 50 cases of hand grenades in his
truck, having just delivered 25 to
Kuku Point, saw the red sun insignia
on the planes as they roared low
overhead. Immediately, he ordered
the vehicle stopped and instructed his
men to head for cover.</p>

<p>Confident that his airborne planes
would be able to provide sufficient
warning of an incoming raid, Commander
Cunningham was working in
his office at Camp 2, when he heard
the “crump” of bombs around 1155.
The explosions rattled windows elsewhere
in the camp, prompting many
men to conclude that work crews
were blasting coral heads in the
lagoon.</p>

<p>Guns 1 and 2 of Battery D opened
up on the attackers, collectively firing
40 rounds during the raid. The
low visibility and the altitude at
which the Mitsubishis flew, however,
prevented the 3-inch guns from firing
effectively. No bombs fell near
the battery, but the guns’ own concussions
caved in the sandbag emplacements,
Marine antiaircraft fire
damaged eight Nells and killed a petty
officer in one of them. Returning
Japanese aircrews claimed to have set
fire to all of the aircraft on the
ground, and reported sighting only
three airborne American planes.</p>

<p>On Peacock Point, First Lieutenant
Lewis’ Battery E had been standing-to,
ready to fire. Like Godbold, Lewis
did not have enough men for all four
of his guns. Lewis manned two of the
3-inchers, along with the M-4 director,
while the rest of his men busily
completed sandbag emplacements.
After telephoning Devereux’s command
post when he saw the falling
bombs, Lewis quickly estimated the
altitude and ordered his gunners to
open fire. Again, however, the height
at which the attackers came rendered
the fire ineffective.</p>

<p>In about seven minutes, Japanese
bombs and bullets totally wrecked
PanAm’s facilities. Bombing and
strafing set fire to a hotel&mdash;in which
five Chamorro employees died&mdash;and
also to a stock room, fuel tanks, and
many other buildings, and
demolished a radio transmitter. Nine
of PanAm’s 66-man staff lay dead.
Two of the <i>Philippine Clipper</i>’s crew
were wounded.</p>

<p>Almost miraculously, though, the
26-ton <i>Clipper</i>, empty of both passengers
and cargo but full of fuel,
rode easily at her moorings at the
end of the dock. A bomb had
splashed 100 feet ahead of her without
damaging her, and she received
23 bullet holes from the strafing
attack&mdash;none had hit her large fuel
tanks. Captain Hamilton courageously
proposed evacuating the passengers
and PanAm staff and
Commander Cunningham assented.
Stripped of all superfluous equipment
and having embarked all of the
passengers and the Caucasian PanAm
employees, save one (who had
been driving the atoll’s only ambulance
and thus had not heard the
call to report for the plane’s departure),
the flying boat took off for
Midway at 1330.</p>

<p>Although he had received a bullet
wound in his left shoulder, Major
Putnam immediately took over the
terrible task of seeing to the many injured
people at the field. His dedication
to duty seemed to establish the
precedent for many other instances
of selflessness which occurred amidst
the wreckage of the VMF-211 camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Sadly, the attack left five pilots and
10 enlisted men of VMF-211 wounded
and 18 more dead, including most
of the mechanics assigned to the
squadron. On the materiel side, the
squadron’s tents were shot up and
virtually no supplies&mdash;tools, spark
plugs, tires, and sparse spare parts&mdash;escaped
destruction. Both of the
25,000-gallon gasoline storage tanks
had been demolished. Additionally,
25 civilian workmen had been killed.</p>

<p>As the bombers departed, Gunner
Hamas called his men back from the
bush, and set out to resume delivery
of hand grenades. As he neared the
airfield, though, he stopped to help
wounded men board a truck that had
escaped destruction. Then, he continued
his journey and finally
returned to Camp 1, where he found
more civilian employees arriving to
join the military effort.</p>

<p>Earlier, as they had returned to the
vicinity of Wake at about noon, Kinney
and Hamilton had been descending
through the broken clouds about
three miles from the atoll when the
former spotted two formations of
planes at an elevation of about 1,500
feet. He and Hamilton attempted unsuccessfully
to catch the formations
as they retired to the west through
the overcast. Kinney and Hamilton
remained aloft until after 1230, when
they landed to find the destruction
that defied description. Neither Elrod
nor Davidson had seen the enemy.</p>

<p>In the wake of the terrible devastation
wreaked upon his squadron,
Putnam deemed it critical to the
squadron’s reorganization to keep the
remaining planes operational. Since
his engineering officer, Graves, had
been killed, Putnam appointed Kinney
to take his place. “We have four
planes left,” Putnam told him, “If you
can keep them flying I’ll see that you
get a medal as big as a pie.” “Okay,
sir,” Kinney responded, “if it is delivered
in San Francisco.”</p>

<p>Putnam established VMF-211’s
command post near the operations
area. His men dug foxholes amidst
brush and all of the physically capable
officers and men stayed at the
field. Putnam ordered that pistols,
Thompson submachine guns, gas
masks, and steel helmets be issued,
and also directed that machine gun
posts be established near each end of
the runway and the command post.
Meanwhile, the ground crews dispersed
the serviceable planes into
revetments, a task not without its
risks. That afternoon, Captain Frank
C. Tharin accidentally taxied 211-F-9
into an oil drum and ruined the
propeller, reducing the serviceable
planes to three. Captains Elrod and
Tharin (the latter wounded superficially
in the attack) later supervised
efforts to construct “protective works”
and also the mining of the landing
strip with dynamite connected up to
electric generators. Contractors bulldozed
portions of the land bordering
the field, in hopes that the rough
ground would wreck any enemy
planes that attempted to land there.</p>

James F. Hesson, USN, kept Wake’s
dwindling number of battered Wildcats
flying throughout the bitter 15-day siege.</i></p></div></div>

<p>That afternoon, over at Battery D,
Godbold’s men repaired damaged
emplacements, improved the director
position, and accepted delivery of gas
masks, hand grenades, and ammunition.
Later that afternoon, 18
civilians reported for military duty.
Godbold assigned 16 of them to serve
under Sergeant Walter A. Bowsher,
Jr., to man the previously idle Gun
3, and assigned the remaining pair to
the director crew as lookouts. Under
Bowsher’s leadership, the men in Gun
3 were soon working their piece “in
a manner comparable to the Marine-manned
guns.”</p>

<p>Gunner Hamas and his men,
meanwhile, carted ammunition from
the quartermaster shed and dispersed
it into caches, each of about 20 to 25
boxes, west of Camp 1, near Wilkes
Channel, and camouflaged them
with coral sand. Next, they dispersed
hundreds of boxes of .50- and .30-caliber
ammunition in the bushes that
lined the road that led to the airfield.
Before nightfall, Hamas delivered
.50-caliber ammunition and metal
links to Captain Herbert C. Freuler
and furnished him the keys to the
bomb and ammunition magazines.</p>

<p>About 25 civilians with trucks
responded to First Lieutenant Lewis’
request for assistance in improving
his battery’s defensive position.
Then, Lewis ordered his men to lay a
telephone line from the battery command
post (CP) to the battery’s
heightfinder so that he could obtain
altitude readings for the incoming
enemy bombers, and relay that information
to the guns.</p>

<p>Commander Campbell Keene,
Commander, Wake Base Detachment,
meanwhile, reassigned his men
to more critical combat duties. He
sent Ensigns George E. Henshaw and
Bernard J. Lauff to Cunningham’s
staff. Boatswain’s Mate First Class
James E. Barnes and 12 enlisted men
joined the ranks of the defense battalion
to drive trucks, serve in galley
details, and stand security
watches. One of the three enlisted
men whom Commander Keene sent
to VMF-211 was Aviation Machinist’s
Mate First Class James F. Hesson.
Kinney and Technical Sergeant
Hamilton soon found the Pennsylvanian
with light brown hair, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
served in the Air Corps before he had
joined the Navy and who had just
turned 35 years of age, to be invaluable.
VMF-211 also benefitted from
the services of civilians Harry Yeager
and “Doc” Stevenson, who reported
to work as mechanics, and Pete
Sorenson, who volunteered to drive
a truck.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the day and
on into the night, in the contractor’s
hospital in Camp 2, Naval Reserve
Lieutenant Gustave M. Kahn, Medical
Corps, and the contractors’ physician,
Dr. Lawton E. Shank, worked
diligently to save as many men as
possible. Some, though, were beyond
help, and despite their best efforts,
four of VMF-211’s men&mdash;including
Second Lieutenant Conderman&mdash;died
that night.</p>

<p>At Peacock Point, that afternoon,
just down the coast from the airfield,
“Barney” Barninger’s men had completed
their foxholes&mdash;overhead
cover, sandbags, and chunks of coral
would come later. Later, at dusk,
Barninger evidently sensed that the
atoll might be in for a long siege.
Thinking that they might not be in
camp again for some time, he sent
some of his men back to Camp 1 to
obtain extra toilet gear and clothing.
In the gathering darkness, he set his
security watches and rotated beach
patrols and observers. Those men
not on watch slept fitfully in their
foxholes.</p>

<p>That night, Wake’s offshore guardians,
<i>Tambor</i> to the north and <i>Triton</i>
to the south, surfaced to recharge
batteries, breathe fresh air, and listen
to radio reports. From those reports
the crews of the <i>Tambor</i> and <i>Triton</i>
finally learned of the outbreak of
war.</p>

<p>The 9th of December dawned with
a clear sky overhead. Over at the airfield,
three planes took off on the early
morning patrol, while Kinney had
a fourth (though without its reserve
gas tank) ready by 0900. A test flight
proved the fourth F4F to be “o.k.,”
since she withstood a 350 mph dive
“without a quiver.” It was just in the
nick of time, for at 1145 on the 9th,
the <i>Chitose Air Group</i> struck again,
as 27 Nells came in at 13,000 feet. Second
Lieutenant David D. Kliewer
and Technical Sergeant Hamilton attacked
straggling bombers, and
claimed one shot down. Battery D’s
number 2 and 4 guns, meanwhile,
collectively fired 100 3-inch rounds.
The Marines damaged 12 planes, but
the enemy suffered only very light
casualties: one man dead and
another slightly wounded.</p>

<p><i>Sgt William J. Hamilton, (seen here on
20 January 1938) was one of two enlisted
pilots serving in VMF-211 at Wake,
and not only flew patrols but helped
keep the squadron’s planes in the air.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Once more, though, the Japanese
wreaked considerable havoc on the
defenders. Most of their bombs fell
near the edge of the lagoon, north of
the airfield, and on Camp 2, demolishing
the hospital and heavily
damaging a warehouse and a metal
shop. One wounded VMF-211 enlisted
man perished in the bombing of
the hospital while the three-man
crew of one of the dispersed gasoline
trucks died instantly when a bomb
exploded in the foxhole in which they
had sought shelter.</p>

<p>Doctors Kahn and Shank and their
assistants evacuated the wounded
and saved as much equipment as
they could. Shank carried injured
men from the burning hospital, courageous
actions that so impressed
Marine Gunner Hamas (who had
been trapped by the raid while carrying
a load of projectiles and powder
to gun positions on Peale) that
he later recommended that Shank be
awarded a Medal of Honor for his
heroism. The hard-pressed medical
people soon moved the wounded and
what medical equipment they could
into magazines 10 and 13, near the
unfinished airstrip, and established
two 21-bed wards.</p>

<p>Once the bombers had gone, the
work of repairs and improving
planes and positions resumed. That
night, because the initial bombing
had destroyed the mechanical loading
machines, a crew of civilians
helped load .50-caliber ammunition.
That same evening, work crews dispersed
food, medical supplies, water,
and lumber to various points around
the atoll, while the communications
center and Wake’s command post
were moved.</p>

<p>Earlier that day from near the tip
of Peacock Point, Marine Gunner
Clarence B. McKinstry of Battery E
had noted one bomber breaking off
from the rest. Supposing that the
plane had taken aerial photographs,
he suggested that the battery be
moved. That afternoon, First Lieutenant
Lewis received orders to reposition
his guns after dark; he was to
leave two 3-inchers in place until the
other two were emplaced, and then
move the last two. Aided by about a
hundred civilians with several trucks,
Lewis and McKinstry succeeded in
shifting the battery&mdash;guns, ammunition,
and sandbags&mdash;to a new location
some 1,500 yards to the northwest.
Marines and workmen set up
dummy guns in the old position.</p>

<p>As the 10th dawned, Marine Gunner
McKinstry found himself with
new duties, having received orders to
proceed to Wilkes and report to Captain
Wesley McC. Platt, commander
of the Wilkes strongpoint. Battery F
comprised four 3-inch guns, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
lacked crewmen, a heightfinder, or a
director. Consequently, McKinstry
could only fire the guns accurately at
short or point-blank range, thus
limiting them to beach protection.
Assisted by one Marine and a crew of
civilians, Gunner McKinstry moved
his guns into battery just in time for
the arrival of 26 Nells which flew
over at 1020 and dropped their
bombs on the airfield and those seacoast
installations at the tip of
Wilkes.</p>

<p>While casualties were light&mdash;Battery
L had one Marine killed and
one wounded (one civilian suffered
shell-shock)&mdash;the equipment and
guns in the positions themselves
received considerable damage. Further,
120 tons of dynamite which had
been stored by the contractors near
the site of the new channel exploded
and stripped the 3-inch battery of
its fresh camouflage. The gunners
moved them closer to the shoreline
and camouflaged them with burnt
brush because they lacked sandbags
with which to construct defensive
shelters for the gun crews.</p>

<p>In a new position, which was up
the coast from the old one, Battery
E’s 3-inchers managed to hurl 100
rounds skyward while bombs began
hitting near Peacock Point. The old
position there was “very heavily
bombed,” and a direct hit set off a
small ammunition dump, vindicating
McKinstry’s hunch about the photo-reconnaissance
plane. Battery D’s
gunners, meanwhile, claimed hits on
two bombers (one of which was seen
to explode later). Although Captain
Elrod, who single-handedly attacked
the formation, claimed two of the
raiders, only one Nell failed to return
to its base.</p>

<p>That night, the itinerant Battery E
shifted to a position on the toe of the
horseshoe on the lagoon side of
Wake. Their daily defensive preparations
complete, Wake’s defenders
awaited what the next dawn would
bring. They had endured three days
of bombings. Some of Cunningham’s
men may have wondered when it
would be their turn to wreak destruction
upon the enemy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At</span> right, in the firing position, is an Army pattern
M3 3-inch antiaircraft gun of the type that the 1st
Defense Battalion had at Wake. Already obsolescent
at the outbreak of World War II, this weapon was the
mainstay of the defense battalions in the first months of
the war. Twelve of these guns were emplaced at Wake.</p>

<p>As early as 1915, the U.S. Army, recognizing the need
for a high-angle firing antiaircraft gun and resolving to
build one from existing stocks, chose the M1903 seacoast
defense gun and redesignated it the M1917. Soon after
America’s entry into World War I, however, the requirement
for a mobile mount (one with less recoil) compelled
the selection of the less powerful M1898 seacoast gun for
conversion to the M1918. Development of both guns and
mounts continued throughout the interwar years, leading
ultimately to the standardization of the gun as the M3 on
the M2 wheeled mount.</p>

<p>On the eve of World War II, each of the seven Marine
defense battalions then activated had 12 3-inch guns in three
four-gun batteries. Each mount weighed a little over six
tons. The normal crew of eight could fire 25 12.87-pound
high-explosive shells per minute. The guns had an effective
ceiling of nearly 30,000 feet and an effective horizontal
range of 14,780 yards.</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A</span> formation of Mitsubishi G3M1 and G3M2 Type 96
bombers (Nell), above, fly in formation in 1942. The
first models flew in 1935, and more than 250 were
still serving in the Japanese land-based naval air arm in December
1941. Nells, instrumental in the reduction of Wake’s
defenses, served alongside the newer, more powerful Mitsubishi
G4M1 Type 97 bombers (Betty)&mdash;earmarked to replace
them in front-line service&mdash;in helping to sink the British capital
ships HMS <i>Prince of Wales</i> and HMS <i>Repulse</i> off
Malaya on 10 December 1941.</p>

<p>Two 1,000-horsepower <i>Kinsei</i> 45 engines enabled the Nell
to reach a speed of 238 miles per hour at 9,840 feet. Normally
crewed by seven men, the G3M2 model carried a

the group’s Nells because of the long distances
involved. Marine antiaircraft or fighter aircraft gunfire at
Wake destroyed at least four Nells during December 1941.
Since the number of G3Ms engaged varied from raid to

scanned the horizon. Those of her
defenders who were not on watch
grabbed what sleep they could.
Shortly before midnight, the <i>Triton</i>
was south of the atoll, charging her
batteries and patrolling on the surface.
At 2315, her bridge lookouts
spied “two flashes” and then the silhouette
of what seemed to be a destroyer,
dimly visible against the
backdrop of heavy clouds that lay
behind her. The <i>Triton</i> submerged
quickly and tracked the unidentifiable
ship; ultimately, she fired a salvo
of four torpedoes from her stern
tubes at 0017 on 11 December 1941&mdash;the
first torpedoes fired from a Pacific
Fleet submarine in World War
II. Although the submariners heard
a dull explosion, indicating what
they thought was at least one probable
hit, and propeller noises appeared
to cease shortly thereafter, the
<i>Triton</i>’s apparent kill had not been
confirmed. She resumed her patrol,
submerged.</p>

<p>The ship that <i>Triton</i> had encountered
off Wake’s south coast was,
most likely, the destroyer deployed
as a picket 10 miles ahead of the invasion
convoy steaming up from the
south. Under Rear Admiral
Sadamichi Kajioka, it had set out
from Kwajalein, in the Marshalls, on
8 December. It consisted of the light
cruiser <i>Yubari</i> (flagship), six
destroyers&mdash;<i>Mutsuki</i>, <i>Kisaragi</i>, <i>Yayoi</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>,
<i>Mochizuki</i>, <i>Oite</i>, and <i>Hayate</i>&mdash;along
with <i>Patrol Boat No. 32</i> and
<i>Patrol Boat No. 33</i> (two ex-destroyers,
each reconfigured in 1941
to launch a landing craft over a stern
ramp) and two armed merchantmen,
<i>Kongo Maru</i> and <i>Kinryu Maru</i>. To
provide additional gunfire support,
the Commander, <i>Fourth Fleet</i>, had
also assigned the light cruisers <i>Tatsuta</i>
and <i>Tenryu</i> to Kajioka’s force.</p>

<p>Admiral Kajioka faced less than
favorable weather for the endeavor.
Deeming the northeast coastline unsuitable
for that purpose, invasion
planners had called for the converted
destroyers to put 150 men ashore on
Wilkes and 300 on Wake. If those
numbers proved insufficient, Kajioka’s
supporting destroyers were to
provide men to augment the landing
force. If contrary winds threatened
the assault, the troops would land on
the northeastern and north coasts.
Since the weather had moderated
enough by the 11th, though, the
force was standing toward the atoll’s
south, or lee, shore in the pre-dawn
hours, confident that two days of
bombings had rendered the islands’
defenses impotent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, far to the east, at Pearl
Harbor, the Pacific Fleet continued
to pick up the pieces after the shattering
blow that the Japanese had
delivered on the 7th. The enemy onslaught
had forced Admiral Husband
E. Kimmel, the Commander in Chief,
Pacific Fleet (CinCPac), to revise his
strategy completely. Kimmel wanted
to relieve Wake, but deploying what
remained of his fleet to protect sea
communications, defend outlying
bases, and protect far-flung territory,
as well as to defend Oahu, would
have required a wide dispersal of the
very limited naval forces. By 10 December
(11 December on Wake), the
scattered positions of his aircraft carriers,
which were at sea patrolling the
Oahu-Johnston-Palmyra triangle,
militated against deploying them to
support Wake. Cunningham’s garrison,
however, in a most striking
fashion, would soon provide inspiration
to the Pacific Fleet and the nation
as well.</p>

<p>Wake’s lookouts, like <i>Triton</i>’s, had
seen flickering lights in the distance.
Gunner Hamas, on duty in the battalion
command post, received the
report of ships offshore from Captain
Wesley McC. Platt, commander
of the strongpoint on Wilkes, and
notified Major Devereux, who, along
with his executive officer, Major
George H. Potter, stepped out into
the moonlight and scanned the
southern horizon. Hamas also telephoned
Cunningham, who ordered
the guns to hold fire until the ships
closed on the island.</p>

<p>Cunningham then turned to Commander
Keene and Lieutenant Commander
Elmer B. Greey, resident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
officer-in-charge of the construction
programs at Wake, with whom he
shared a cottage, and told them that
lookouts had spotted ships, undoubtedly
hostile ones, standing toward
the atoll. He then directed the two
officers to order an alert and immediately
headed for the island’s communications
center in his pickup truck.</p>

<p>As the Japanese ships neared
Wake, the Army radio unit on the
atoll sent a message from Cunningham
to Pearl Harbor at 0200 on the
11th, telling of the contractors’
casualties, and, because of the danger
that lay at Wake’s doorstep, suggesting
early evacuation of the civilians.
Army communicators on Oahu who
received the message noted that the
Japanese had tried to jam the transmission.</p>

<p>At 0400, Major Putnam put
VMF-211 on the alert, and soon
thereafter he and Captains Elrod,
Tharin, and Freuler manned the four
operational F4Fs. The Wildcats, a
100-pound bomb under each wing,
then taxied into position for take-off.
Shortly before 0500, Kajioka’s ships
began their final run. At 0515, three
Wildcats took off, followed after five
minutes by the fourth. They rendezvoused
at 12,000 feet above Toki
Point. At 0522, the Japanese began
shelling Wake.</p>

<p>The Marines’ guns, however, remained
silent as Kajioka’s ships “crept
in, firing as they came.” The first enemy
projectiles set the oil tanks on the
southwest portion of Wake ablaze
while the two converted destroyers
prepared to land their <i>Special Naval
Landing Force</i> troops. The column of
warships advanced westward, still
unchallenged. Nearing the western
tip of Wake 20 minutes later, Kajioka’s
flagship, the <i>Yubari</i>, closed to within
4,500 yards, seemingly “scouring
the beach” with her 5.5-inch fire. At
0600, the light cruiser reversed course
yet again, and closed the range still
further.</p>

<p>The <i>Yubari</i>’s maneuvering prompted
the careful removal of the brush
camouflage, and the Marines began
to track the Japanese ships. As the
distance decreased, and the reports
came into Devereux’s command post
with that information, the major
again told Gunner Hamas to relay the
word to Commander Cunningham,
who, by that point, had reached his
command post. Cunningham upon
receiving Hamas’ report, responded,
“What are we waiting for, open fire.
Must be Jap ships all right.” Devereux
quickly relayed the order to his anxious
artillerymen. At 0610, they commenced
firing.</p>

<p>Barninger’s 5-inchers at Peacock
Point, Wake’s “high ground” behind
them, boomed and sent the first
50-pound projectiles beyond their
target. Adjusting the range quickly,
the gunners soon scored what seemed
to be hits on the <i>Yubari</i>. Although
Barninger’s guns had unavoidably
revealed their location, the ships’
counterfire proved woefully inaccurate.
Kajioka’s flagship managed to
land only one shell in Battery B’s vicinity,
a projectile that burst some
150 feet from Barninger’s command
post. “The fire ... continued to be
over and then short throughout her
firing,” Barninger later reported. “She
straddled continually, but none of the
salvoes came into the position.” It was
fortunate that the Japanese fire
proved as poor as it was, for Barninger’s
guns lay completely unprotected,
open save for camouflage.
No sandbag protection existed!</p>

<p>Captain Platt, meanwhile, told
Major Potter via phone that, since
Battery L’s rangefinder had been
damaged in the bombing the previous
day, First Lieutenant McAlister
was having trouble obtaining the
range. After Platt passed along Potter’s
order to McAlister to estimate it,
Battery L opened fire and scored hits
on one of the transports, prompting
the escorting destroyers to stand
toward the troublesome guns.</p>

<p>Platt carefully scrutinized the
Japanese ship movements offshore,
and noted with satisfaction that
McAlister’s 5-inchers sent three salvoes
slamming into the <i>Hayate</i>. She
exploded immediately, killing all of
her 167-man crew. McAlister’s gunners
cheered and then turned their attention
to the <i>Oite</i> and the
<i>Mochizuki</i>, which soon suffered hits
from the same guns. The <i>Oite</i> sustained
14 wounded; the <i>Mochizuki</i>
sustained an undetermined number
of casualties.</p>

<p>First Lieutenant Kessler’s Battery B,
at the tip of Peale, meanwhile, dueled
with the destroyers <i>Yayoi</i>, <i>Mutsuki</i>,
and <i>Kisaragi</i>, as well as the <i>Tenryu</i>
and the <i>Tatsuta</i>, and drew heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
counterfire that disabled one gun.
The crew of the inoperable mount
shifted to that of a serviceable one,
serving as ammunition passers, and
after 10 rounds, Kessler’s remaining
gun scored a hit on the <i>Yayoi</i>’s stern,
killing one man, wounding 17, and
starting a fire. His gunners then shifted
their attention to the next destroyer
in column. The enemy’s counterfire
severed communications between
Kessler’s command post and the gun,
but Battery B&mdash;the muzzle blast temporarily
disabling the rangefinder&mdash;continued
with local fire control. As
the Japanese warships stood to the
south, Kessler’s gun hurled two parting
shots toward a transport, which
proved to have been out of range.</p>

  <div class="caption bold"><p>MAP 2</p>

<p>SURFACE ACTION OF 11 DECEMBER 1941</p>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Yubari</i>’s action record reflects
that although Wake had been pounded
by land-based planes, the atoll’s
defenders still possessed enough
coastal guns to mount a ferocious
defense, which forced Kajioka to retire.
As if the seacoast guns and the
weather were not enough to frustrate
the admiral’s venture&mdash;the heavy seas
had overturned landing boats almost
as soon as they were launched&mdash;the
Japanese soon encountered a new
foe. While Cunningham’s cannoneers
had been trading shells with Kajioka’s,
Putnam’s four Wildcats had
climbed to 20,000 feet and maintained
that altitude until daylight,
when the major had ascertained that
no Japanese planes were airborne. As
the destroyers that had dueled Battery
B opened the range and stood
away from Wake, the Wildcats
roared in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>Major Putnam saw at least one of
Elrod’s bombs hit the <i>Kisaragi</i>. Trailing
oil and smoke, the damaged destroyer
slowed to a stop but then
managed to get underway again, internally
afire. While she limped away
to the south, Elrod, antiaircraft fire
having perforated his plane’s oil line,
headed home. He managed to reach
Wake and land on the rocky beach,
but VMF 211’s ground crew wrote off
his F4F as a total loss. Meanwhile,
<i>Tenryu</i> came under attack by Putnam,
Tharin, and Freuler, who
strafed her forward, near the number
1 torpedo tube mount, wounding
five men and disabling three
torpedoes.</p>

<p>The three serviceable Wildcats
then shuttled back and forth to be
rearmed and refueled. Putnam and
Kinney later saw the <i>Kisaragi</i>&mdash;which
had been carrying an extra
supply of depth charges because of
the American submarine threat&mdash;blow
up and sink, killing her entire
crew of 167 men. Freuler, Putnam,
and Hamilton strafed the <i>Kongo
Maru</i>, igniting barrels of gasoline
stowed in one of her holds, killing
three Japanese sailors, and wounding
19. Two more men were listed as
missing. Freuler’s Wildcat took a
bullet in the engine but managed to
return to the field. Technical Sergeant
Hamilton reached the field despite a
perforated tail section.</p>

<p>The <i>Triton</i>, which had not made
contact with an enemy ship since firing
at the unidentified ship during
the pre-dawn hours, did not participate
in the action that morning.
Neither did her sistership, the <i>Tambor</i>.
The latter attempted to approach
the enemy ships she observed firing
at the atoll, until they appeared to be
standing away from Wake. Then, she
reversed course and proceeded north,
well away from the retiring Japanese,
to avoid penetrating the <i>Triton</i>’s
patrol area.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after Kinney witnessed
the <i>Kisaragi</i>’s cataclysmic
demise, he strafed another destroyer
before returning to the field. Having
been rearmed and refueled, he
took off again at 0915, accompanied
by Second Lieutenant Davidson,
shortly before 17 Nells appeared to
bomb Peale’s batteries.</p>

<p>Davidson battled nine of the
bombers, which had separated from
the others and headed toward the
southwest. Kinney tackled the other
eight. Battery D, meanwhile, hurled
125 rounds at the bombers. Although
some of the enemy’s bombs fell near
the battery position on Peale, the
Japanese again inflicted neither
damage nor casualties, and lost two
Nells in the process. Eleven other
G3M2s had been damaged; casualties
included 15 dead and one slightly
wounded. Putnam later credited Kinney
and Davidson with shooting
down one plane apiece.</p>

<p>Ordered to move Battery D’s
3-inch guns the length of Peale during
the night, Godbold reconnoitered
the new position selected by Major
Devereux, and at 1745, after securing
all battery positions, began the
shift. For the next 11 hours, the Marines,
assisted by nearly 250 civilians,
constructed new emplacements. By
0445 on 12 December, Godbold
could again report: “Manned and
ready.” At Peacock Point, on the
night of the 11th, Wally Lewis gave
permission for all but two men at
each gun, and at the director, to get
some sleep&mdash;the first the men had
had in three days.</p>

<p>Well before dawn on 12 December,
unsynchronized engines heralded the
approach of a Japanese flying boat.
Captains Freuler and Tharin scrambled
their planes to intercept it. The
enemy plane&mdash;a Kawanishi H6K
Type 97 reconnaissance flying boat
(Mavis) from the <i>Yokohama Air
Group</i> dropped its bombs on the
edge of the lagoon and then sought
cover in the overcast and rain squalls.
Tharin, although untrained in night
aerial combat techniques, chased and
“splashed” it. None of its nine-man
crew survived.</p>

<p>Later that same day, 26 <i>Chitose Air
Group</i> Nells bombed Wake Island.
Returning aircrewmen claimed
damage to a warehouse and an antiaircraft
gun in the “western sector.”
Antiaircraft fire shot down one plane
and damaged four; Japanese casualties
included eight men killed. Once
the bombers had departed, “Barney”
Barninger’s men continued working
on their foxholes, freshened the
camouflage, cleaned the guns, and
tried to catch some sleep. The daily
bombings, he wrote later, “were becoming
an old story, and it was a
relief from waiting when the raid was
over.”</p>

<p>Weathering bombing attacks, taking
the enemy’s blows, was one thing,
but striking at the Japanese was
something else&mdash;something to boost
morale. At about 1600 on the 12th,
Second Lieutenant Kliewer, while
patrolling, spotted a surfaced submarine
25 miles southwest of Wake.
With the sun behind him, he dove
from 10,000 feet. Convinced that the
submarine was Japanese, Kliewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
fired his four .50-calibers broadside
into the submarine. Turning to the
right, and seeking to increase his
chances of scoring maximum damage
on the enemy, he dove and dropped
his two 100-pounders at such a low
altitude that bomb fragments ripped
large holes in his wings and tail surfaces.
Emptying his guns into the
submarine on his next pass, he
looked behind him and saw her submerge.
Major Putnam flew out to
verify that the sub had been sunk
and spotted an oil slick at the spot
Kliewer indicated.</p>

<p>That night, a stateside radio report
praised Wake’s Marines. It stated that
for security reasons it could not mention
the size of the garrison defending
the atoll, but noted that “we
know the number is very small.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like letting the enemy
know our status,” Kinney noted
sardonically in his diary. “Still no
help.”</p>

<p>Although help was a subject very
much on the minds of Admiral Kimmel
and his staff back at Pearl Harbor,
by 11 December plans to reinforce
Wake had not yet “crystallized.”
Nor could they, until the carriers
around which any task forces could
be formed could be marshalled for
the task. As Captain Charles H.
“Soc” McMorris, Kimmel’s war plans
officer, had estimated, all of the nearly
1,500 people on Wake could be accommodated
very rapidly on board
the seaplane tender <i>Tangier</i> (AV-8) if
they either destroyed or abandoned
their personal belongings. <i>Tangier</i>
would be crowded, but he believed it
could be done. Protecting the tender,
though, was key. “She should not go,”
McMorris wrote, “until air protection
is available.” If the evacuation of
Wake was decided upon&mdash;and he recommended
against it&mdash;the “promptest
measure” would be to have <i>Tangier</i>
assigned to a task force formed
around the aircraft carrier <i>Lexington</i>
(CV-2). Then, accompanied by destroyers,
she could evacuate Wake’s
garrison while <i>Lexington</i>’s planes
provided cover. Even as the people
at Pearl Harbor considered plans for
her employment, however, “Lady
Lex” and her consorts were encountering
difficulty refueling in the
heavy seas northwest of Oahu. Ultimately,
Task Force 12 had to put into
Pearl to complete the refueling.</p>

<p>The following day, 13 December,
found VMF-211 conducting its
patrols as usual with three available
aircraft. Meanwhile, ground crews
dragged Captain Elrod’s old plane
over from the beach and propped it
up across the runway to serve as a
decoy. The contractors promised Kinney
that a light-proof hangar would
be finished that night.</p>

<p>Listening to the radio that evening
provided little inspiration. As Kinney
noted in his diary, Kay Kyser, the
reknowned bandleader, had dedicated
a song to the “Wake Marines,”
while commentators noted that
Wake’s defenders, when asked what
they required, had said “Send us
more Japs.”</p>

<p>“We began to figure out,” Kinney
wrote, “that the U.S. was not going
to reinforce us.”</p>

<p>At Pearl Harbor, however, efforts
proceeded apace to disprove those
who despaired of relief: the <i>Tangier</i>
began discharging aviation gasoline
to a barge alongside, as she prepared
for her impending mission. Early the
following morning, she began unloading
warheads and torpedoes and
commenced loading aviation stores
earmarked for Wake. Later, she shifted
to the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard,
where she continued discharging
gasoline and unloading torpedoes.
“Wake Island,” Rear Admiral Claude
Bloch, the Commandant of the 14th
Naval District, wrote on 12 December
(13 December on Wake) “is putting
up a magnificent fight. Kimmel
is doing his best to devise means for
reinforcing it and getting out the
civilians....” The <i>Lexington</i> and her
consorts entered Pearl to fuel on 13
December, while <i>Saratoga</i> (CV-3)
and her escorts (three old destroyers)
steamed toward Oahu&mdash;also delayed
by heavy weather.</p>

<p>The enemy, meanwhile, maintained
aerial pressure on the atoll.
Three flying boats bombed the island
at 0437 on Sunday, 14 December, but
did not damage anything. The Marines,
sailors, and contractors went
about their daily business of improving
their defensive positions. The artillerymen
replaced the natural
camouflage with fresh foliage.</p>

<p>Wake had little need for “more
Japs,” despite media claims. It did,
however, need tools with which it
could defend itself. Cunningham
radioed to the Commandant of the
14th Naval District a lengthy list of
supplies&mdash;including fire control
radars&mdash;required by his 5- and 3-inch
batteries, as well as by the machine
gun and searchlight batteries.</p>

<p>At the airfield, the 14th dawned
with just two planes in service. Kinney
determined, though, that one of
those, an F4F “bought” from VF-6
(embarked on the USS <i>Enterprise</i>),
required an engine replacement.
They would scavenge the parts required
from two irreparably
damaged planes. As a work crew
tackled that task, 30 Nells from the
<i>Chitose Air Group</i> began sowing
destruction across Wake. One bomb
hit one of the aircraft shelters and set
afire an F4F.</p>

<p><i>The seaplane tender</i> Tangier <i>(AV-8) (seen here off Mare Island,
California, in August 1941), a converted freighter, had elements
of the 4th Defense Battalion embarked as well as vitally
needed ammunition and equipment, including radar.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Scrambling over to that Wildcat
after the raid had ended, Kinney saw
that the enemy ordnance had hit
close to the tail but had damaged
only the oil tank and intercoolers.
Since that was the squadron’s best engine,
Kinney knew that it must be removed,
mount and all. Kinney used
an improvised hoist to lift the plane
by its nose.</p>

<p>With only the single makeshift
hoist, Kinney and his crew removed
one engine and attached the other
mount by nightfall, fortified only by
a gallon of ice cream which Pete
Sorenson, one of the contractors, had
thoughtfully brought them. Since the
hangar was not complete, they had to
work quickly to avoid the blackout.</p>

<p>Kinney instructed the civilian foreman
to call him as soon as the hangar
was ready to receive the plane.
He sent Hamilton to bed at 0800, and
retired, himself, to be awakened an
hour and a half later. With Hamilton
in tow, he awoke the three
civilians who had been helping them,
and all went to the hangar. With a
bit more effort, they were ready for
the aircraft at 1130. Kinney and his
civilian helpers completed installing
the engine by 0330 on the 15th.</p>

<p>The failure to have the hangars
completed, meanwhile, proved to be
a sore point for Major Putnam.
Commander Cunningham differed
with his Marine subordinate over just
how much pressure to apply to the
civilians, eschewing the use of armed
force in favor of addressing the workers
in small groups and appealing
to them to lend a hand.</p>

<p>Annoyed that Cunningham
seemed to be using only “moral suasion”
on the contractors, Putnam, on
14 December, personally persuaded
the contractors to work on the underground
shelters&mdash;no work having
been done for the previous 24
hours&mdash;and the civilians turned out
in force (“about 300 when only 50
could work,” Kinney noted).</p>

<p>The enthusiastic turnout, however,
had an unexpected effect. Curiosity
moved many workmen to line the
airstrip to watch the take-off of the
evening patrol. The surging crowd
caused Captain Freuler to ease his
plane to the left to avoid hitting any
men, and in so doing found that he
had aimed the plane toward a crane
which sat on the north side of the airfield.
Continuing to the left, Freuler
tried to miss the piece of heavy
equipment but instead “ground-looped”
his F4F into the “boondocks,”
wrecking it. Hauled back to the runway,
the damaged Wildcat served,
thereafter, as a decoy.</p>

<p>At Pearl Harbor, at 1231 on 14 December
(0901 15 December, on
Wake), Task Force 11 (formerly Task
Force 12) stood out to sea. Its commander,
Vice Admiral Wilson
Brown, had been ordered to raid
Jaluit to divert attention away from
Task Force 14, which was to sortie the
following day and proceed to Wake.
Brown’s force was to conduct the raid
on Jaluit&mdash;reckoned to be the center
of Japanese operations in the
Marshalls&mdash;and then to retire toward
Pearl Harbor the day before Task
Force 14, under Rear Admiral Frank
Jack Fletcher, was to reach Wake.</p>

<p>Fletcher’s task, meanwhile, was to
see that the <i>Tangier</i> reached her objective.
The <i>Saratoga</i>, with VMF-221
embarked, was to launch the Marine
fighters to fly into Wake while the
seaplane tender was to moor offshore
to begin the process of putting ashore
reinforcements, ammunition, provisions,
and equipment&mdash;including an
important radar set. The <i>Tangier</i> was
then to embark approximately 650
civilians and all of the wounded men
and return to Pearl Harbor. Kimmel
and his staff had estimated that the
process of unloading and debarkation
would take at least two days;
embarking all the people at Wake
could be accomplished in less than
one. Unfavorable weather, however,
could lengthen the time considerably.
At 1331 (at Pearl Harbor), on 15 December
Kimmel informed the Chief
of Naval Operations (Admiral
Harold R. Stark) of the relief expedition
he had just launched. He
received Admiral Stark’s concurrence
early the following morning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the day on the
15th, Dan Godbold’s men observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the usual routine, starting the day at
full alert and replacing the natural
camouflage before reducing the alert
status at 0700. His men completed
the shelters near the guns during the
day and began work on a shelter at
the heightfinder position. They
stopped work at 1700 to return to full
alert. A half hour later, however, battery
lookouts reported a plane lurking
amongst the low clouds to the
east, and Godbold reported the
presence of the intruder to the island
command post. At 1800, four flying
boats came in at 1,000 feet and
dropped bombs on what their crews
thought was the “barracks area
(Camp 1) on the northern part of the
island.” They also strafed the area
near Batteries D and B. The Japanese
reported their bombing as having
been “effective,” but it inflicted no
material damage. One civilian workman
was killed. From his vantage
point, Marine Gunner McKinstry, in
Battery E, thought all of the bombs
landed in the ocean.</p>

<p>The next day, the 16th, 33 Nells
raided Wake Island at 1340. The Marines,
however, greeted the Japanese
fliers with novel fire control methods.
Kinney and Kliewer, aloft on patrol,
spotted the incoming formations
closing on the atoll at 18,000 feet,
almost 10 minutes before they
reached Wake’s airspace. The U.S. pilots
radioed the enemy’s altitude to
the gun batteries. The early warning
permitted Lewis to enter the data into
the M-4 director and pass the solution
to Godbold. Battery D hurled 95
rounds skyward. Battery E’s first
shots seemed to explode ahead of the
formation, but Gunner McKinstry
reported that the lead plane in one
of the formations dropped, smoking,
to the rear of the formation. He estimated
that at least four other planes
cleared the island trailing smoke.
Godbold estimated that four planes
had been damaged and one had
crashed some distance from the island.
Japanese accounts, however,
provide no support for Godbold’s estimate,
acknowledging neither losses
nor damage to Japanese aircraft
during the attack that day. Kliewer
and Kinney each attacked the formations
of planes, but with little effect,
partly because only one of Kinney’s
four machine guns functioned.</p>

<p>That day, as half of Wake’s submarine
support&mdash;the <i>Tambor</i>&mdash;retired
toward Oahu because of an irreparable
leak in her forward torpedo
room, Kinney returned to the task of
keeping the planes ready to fight with
field expedient repairs and borrowed
gear. Kinney and his helpers fashioned
gun cleaning rods from welding
rods. The pervasive, intrusive
coral sand threatened to cause severe
mechanical damage to the planes.
Kinney borrowed a compressor from
PanAm (two previous compressors
had been “strafed out of commission”)
to try to keep the planes clean
by blasting a mixture of air and kerosene
to blow out the accumulations
of grit.</p>

<p>To help Kinney and Hamilton and
their small but dedicated band of
civilians, Aviation Machinist’s Mate
Hesson, who had been wounded on
the 14th, violated doctor’s orders and
returned to duty. He resumed work
on the planes, carrying on as effectively
as ever in spite of his injures.
Putnam later recalled Hesson’s service
as being “the very foundation of
the entire aerial defense of Wake
Island.”</p>

<p>At Pearl Harbor, in the lengthening
shadows of 15 December (16 December
on Wake), the relief expedition
made ready to sail. The <i>Tangier</i>,
the oiler <i>Neches</i> (AO-5) and four
destroyers sailed at 1730 on the 15th
(On Wake, 1400 on 16 December.).
The <i>Saratoga</i> and the remainder of
the escort&mdash;delayed by the time it
took to fuel the carrier&mdash;were to sail
the following day. “The twilight sortie,”
First Lieutenant Robert D. Heinl,
Jr., as commander of Battery F,
3-Inch Antiaircraft Group, wrote of
the <i>Tangier</i>’s sailing, “dramatized the
adventure.” The ships steamed past
somber reminders of 7 December&mdash;the
beached battleship <i>Nevada</i> and
a Douglas SBD Dauntless from the
<i>Enterprise</i> that had been shot down
by “friendly fire” off Fort Kamehameha.
“The waters beyond sight of
Oahu,” First Lieutenant Heinl noted,
“seemed very lonely waters indeed....
Columbus’ men, sailing westward
in hourly apprehension of toppling
off the edge of a square earth,
could not have felt the seas to be
more inscrutable and less friendly.”</p>

<p>Wake’s dogged defense caused Vice
Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue, Commander,
<i>South Seas Force</i> (<i>Fourth
Fleet</i>), to seek help. Admiral Isoroku
Yamamoto, the Commander in Chief
of the <i>Combined Fleet</i>, responded by
assigning a force under the command
of Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe, Commander,
<i>8th Cruiser Division</i>, consisting
of carriers <i>Hiryu</i> and <i>Soryu</i>
and escorting ships, to reinforce Inoue.
At 1630 on 16 December, the
two carriers (with 118 aircraft),
screened by the heavy cruisers <i>Tone</i>
and <i>Chikuma</i> and the destroyers
<i>Tanikaze</i> and <i>Urakaze</i>, detached
from their <i>Pearl Harbor Striking
Force</i>, and headed toward Wake.</p>

<p>As Abe’s ships steamed toward
Wake, U.S. Navy radio intelligence
operators intercepted Japanese radio
transmissions. The messages, when
decoded, caused the intelligence
analysts to suspect that connections
existed among the Japanese <i>Fourth
Fleet</i> operations “CruDiv 8” (the <i>Tone</i>
and the <i>Chikuma</i>), “Cardiv 2” (the
<i>Soryu</i> and the <i>Hiryu</i>), and “Airon 24”
(<i>24th Flotilla</i>). Aerial reconnaissance
flights from the Marshalls followed.</p>

<p>The following afternoon Rear Admiral
Bloch sent a message that must
have seemed a trifle unrealistic to
Cunningham, who was primarily
concerned with defending the atoll
and keeping his men alive. The message
stated that it was “highly desirable”
that the dredging of the channel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
across Wilkes continue and inquired
about the feasibility “under present
conditions” of finishing the work
with equipment at hand. It requested
an estimated date of completion.</p>

<p>On 17 December, something occurred
at Pearl Harbor which harbored
ill portents for the Wake Island
relief operation. Admiral Kimmel
was relieved of command. In a perfunctory
ceremony at the Submarine
Base, Kimmel relinquished command
to Vice Admiral William S. Pye, who
would serve as the acting commander
until Admiral Chester W.
Nimitz arrived to assume command.
Pye inherited an operation about
which he would soon harbor many
reservations. The next day (18 December),
CinCPac’s radio intelligence
men noted again that ... “Cardiv
and Crudiv 8 continued to be associated
with the Fourth Fleet in communications.”</p>

<p>While the acting CinCPac digested
that latest disquieting intelligence and
sent it along to Fletcher and Brown,
Wake’s defenders endured another air
raid. On the 19th, 27 Nells came in
from the northwest at 1135, and
dropped bombs on the remainder of
the PanAm facility on Peale and on
Camp 1 on Wake. Battery D fired 70
rounds at the attacking planes, and
both Godbold and Marine Gunner
McKinstry reported seeing one plane
leaving the sky over the atoll, trailing
a plume of smoke behind it. An
aviator, they said, drifted down in his
parachute some distance from land.
Wake’s gunners had actually done far
better than they had thought. Of 27
planes engaged, 12 had been hit by
antiaircraft fire.</p>

<p>Cunningham responded to Bloch’s
message of the previous day that up
to that point he had been concerned
only with defending the island and
preserving lives. He addressed the
completion of the channel by listing
the difficulties associated with the
task. He pointed out that blackout
conditions militated working at
night, and that Japanese air raids,
which came without warning,
reduced the amount of work which
could be accomplished during the
day. But working during the day was
hazardous, he said, because noisy
equipment prevented workmen from
being alerted to the incoming planes
in time for them to take cover. Furthermore,
the amount of contractor’s
equipment was being continually
reduced by the bombings. Additionally,
continuing the projects would
require the immediate replenishment
of diesel oil and dynamite. With
morale of the civilian workmen
generally low, Cunningham could
not predict, under the prevailing conditions,
when the construction
projects would be completed. He further
declared that “relief from raids
would improve [the] outlook.” After
recording, in a second message the
damage inflicted by the Japanese on
the base on Peale, the atoll commander
noted that, since the outbreak
of war, the efforts involved in
assisting in the defense and salvage
operations had fully occupied all of
the contractors’ men. Cunningham
continued by noting the additional
numbers of dead or missing civilians
since his earlier dispatch on the subject,
and described the civilians’
morale as “extremely low.” He reiterated
his request to consider evacuating
the civilians, since the large
number of them who were not contributing
to the defensive efforts required
sustenance, which drew on
the stores required by those actively
engaged in the defensive operations.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Vice Admiral Pye
had passed on to Brown information
pointing toward Japan’s establishment
of an air base in the Gilberts
and the existence of a submarine
force at Jaluit. Most disturbing of all
was the news that CinCPac’s intelligence
people knew of “no definite location
of [the] force which attacked
Oahu.” For all anyone knew, the
Japanese carriers whose planes had
bombed Pearl Harbor could be lurking
almost anywhere!</p>

<p>Considering the newly established
enemy air bases that he would have
to pass en route to Jaluit, Brown
could see that Japanese air searches
from those places might spot Task
Force 11 before it reached its objective.
He began fueling his ships on
the 18th&mdash;the same day that Rear
Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr.’s Task
Force 8 sailed from Pearl to support
Task Forces 11 and 14&mdash;and informed
the task force of its objective. Brown
completed the fueling operations on
the 19th. That done, he detached his
oiler, the <i>Neosho</i> (AO-23), to stand
out of danger, and contemplated
what lay ahead.</p>

<p>Fletcher’s Task Force 14, meanwhile,
pressed westward. At noon on
the 19th, the <i>Saratoga</i> and her consorts
were 1,020 miles east of Wake.
D-Day had been set for the 24th.</p>

<h3 title="Sidebar: Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher" class="hideme p0"></h3>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Admiral</span> Frank Jack Fletcher, the
commander of Task Force 14,
is the subject of much historical
“Monday morning quarterbacking.”
All these commentators have the benefit
of something neither Pye, the overall
commander, nor Fletcher, on the scene,
had&mdash;hindsight. As “Soc” McMorris
(Admiral Kimmel’s war plans officer) put
it, “We had no more idea’n a billygoat,”
about what Japanese forces lay off
Wake. The welter of message traffic linking
CruDivs, CarDivs, and BatDivs with
land-based air painted a formidable picture
of what might be encountered by a
<i>single</i> U.S. Navy carrier task force.
While the Navy pilots may have been
well trained, <i>Saratoga</i>’s embarked fighter
squadron was understrength, having
only 13 operational Wildcats.</p>

<div id="ip_17" class="figright" style="width: 173px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_017.jpg" width="173" height="238" alt="" /></div>

<p>Nor could the Marines of VMF-221
(bound for Wake) have been counted on
as an effective adjunct to <i>Saratoga</i>’s
squadron, since they had not operated
from a carrier. An even more compelling
argument for how VMF-221 would have
performed in the emergency is that
Major General Ross Rowell, commanding
the 2d Marine Aircraft Wing, knowing
of 221’s manpower and operational
deficiencies, lamented having to send
“[Major Verne] McCaul’s half-baked outfit
into that mess.” Rowell knew that
maintaining the temperamental Brewster
F2A-3 Buffalo fighters at a stateside air
base with all the conveniences had been
a chore&mdash;let alone having to operate the
F2A-3 at an advance base (especially one
that had been so badly cut-up as Wake
had been) or at sea on a carrier (where
the F2A’s performance&mdash;especially with
landing gear failures&mdash;was nearly infamous).</p>

<p>And, too, the three carriers committed
to the relief expedition were all there
were in the Pacific. There were no
reserves. Even though the Japanese harbored
no ideas of conquest of Hawaii at
that time&mdash;they were through with
Oahu for the time being&mdash;Pye and his
advisors had no way of knowing that.
What intelligence existed pointed toward
a potential disaster for an island where
the issue was, as Cunningham correctly
perceived, very much in doubt!</p>

<p>When asked in 1970 if the relief expedition’s
arrival would have made any
difference in the outcome at Wake, retired
Brigadier General Devereux answered:
“I rather doubt that that
particular task force, with its size and
composition, could have been very effective....
I think it was wise ... to
pull back.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="All_Hands_Have" id="All_Hands_Have"></a>‘<i>All Hands Have
Behaved Splendidly</i>’</h2>

<p>Shortly before 1600 on 20 December,
scrutinized by Wake Island’s
only serviceable F4F, a Consolidated
PBY Catalina flying boat bearing
mail landed in the lagoon. It arrived
in the midst of a rain squall, but the
defenders welcomed the precipitation
because it worsened the flying
weather and inhibited the Japanese
bombing efforts. Commander
Keene’s sailors moored the Catalina
and fueled it for the next morning’s
flight.</p>

<p>As “Barney” Barninger observed,
the flying boat’s arrival “set the island
on end with scuttlebutt.” Most men
surmised that the civilians would be
evacuated. The scuttlebutt was partially
correct. From the secret orders
carried on board the PBY, Cunningham
learned that he was to prepare
all but 350 civilians (those to be
selected “by specific trades to continue
the more important of the
projects,” one of which was the completion
of the ship channel between
Wake and Wilkes) for evacuation. He
was also notified that fire control, radar,
and other equipment was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
sent, along with reinforcements of
both men and machinery.</p>

<p>That day, Commander Cunningham
recounted the events which had
occurred to date in a report to Rear
Admiral Bloch. Although many air
raids had occurred, he reported, that
most had resulted in few casualties
and little damage to installations. He
attributed Wake’s escape from more
serious damage to the effectiveness
of the Marines’ antiaircraft fire&mdash;fire
delivered despite the lack of fire control
equipment. A former fighter pilot,
he also lavished unstinting praise
on VMF-211’s aviators, who had
“never failed to push home attacks
against heavy fire.” That none of the
planes had been shot down, he marvelled,
“is a miracle.”</p>

<p>The representative of the Bureau
of the Budget, Herman P. Hevenor,
who had arrived on Wake via the
<i>Clipper</i> on 7 December to check the
progress of construction on the atoll
and review the expenditures, wrote to
the Bureau telling them of the siege to
that point and praising those who led
the defense. “The Commanding Officer
[Cunningham] and his staff, including
the Marine Officers, have
done a big job and an efficient one.
Their stand against the Japs has been
marvelous and they deserve everything
our Government can give them....”</p>

<p>Major Putnam dashed off a report
of VMF-211’s operations to Lieutenant
Colonel Claude A. Larkin,
commanding officer of Marine Aircraft
Group (MAG) 21. After recounting
the losses of both planes
and men suffered by his squadron,
and the damage he felt his men had
inflicted upon the enemy, Putnam
wrote that a large share of the squadron’s
records had been destroyed on
the first day, and since then, “parts
and assemblies have been traded
back and forth so that no airplane
can be identified. Engines have been
traded from plane to plane, have
been junked, stripped, rebuilt, and all
but created.” Practically all of 211’s
gear had been destroyed. Quartermaster
property lay scattered about,
wholly unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he praised his men.
“All hands have behaved splendidly
and held up in a manner of which the
Marine Corps may well tell.” He singled
out the “indefatigable labor, the
ingenuity, skill, and technical
knowledge of Lieutenant Kinney and
Technical Sergeant Hamilton,” since
“it is solely due to their efforts that
the squadron is still operating.”<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> In a marginal note to this report by Putnam
upon his return from a POW camp in Japan,
in October 1945, he added AMM1c Hesson’s
name to those of Kinney and Hamilton.</p></div>

<p>The next morning the PBY crew
and their only passenger, Major
Walter L.&nbsp;J. Bayler, who had completed
his temporary duty at Wake,
clambered on board the Catalina.
The PBY taxied into the lagoon and
took off for Midway.</p>

<p>As the PBY departed, a Japanese
task force steamed toward Wake Island,
intent upon attacking on the
22d. The arrival and departure of
that PBY, however, influenced the
Japanese plans. On 20 December,
Rear Admiral Abe received a report
(based upon the radio messages the
PBY sent as it approached Wake) that
planes from Patrol Squadron 23 had
advanced to Wake from Midway the
previous day. Consequently, the
commander of the <i>South Seas Force</i>,
hoping to catch and destroy those
planes, pressed Abe to advance the
attack one day. The <i>Wake Island
Reinforcement Force</i> increased its
speed to 30 knots.</p>

<p>In the meantime, on the morning
of 21 December, Rear Admiral Kajioka
set out from the Marshalls for a
second attempt at Wake. The attacking
naval forces included the same
ships that had participated in the first
attack, the destroyers <i>Asanagi</i> and
<i>Yunagi</i> (which replaced the <i>Hayate</i>
and the <i>Kisaragi</i>, which had been
sunk during the initial attack), and
some reinforcements, four heavy
cruisers (<i>Kako</i>, <i>Aoba</i>, <i>Furutaka</i> and
<i>Kinugasa</i>) that had recently taken
part in the occupation of Guam, and
the seaplane carrier <i>Kiyokawa Maru</i>.
Instead of 225 troops in each converted
destroyer, 250 (some of whom had
taken part in the seizure of Guam)
had been embarked. Landing exercises
had been conducted at
Kwajalein.</p>

<p>At 0700 on the 21st, beneath
cloudy skies, <i>Hiryu</i> and <i>Soryu</i>
turned into the northeasterly wind
and began launching planes. The aircraft
arrived over Wake at about
0900 to find a 200-meter ceiling and,
seeing no U.S. patrol planes, circled
at 50 to 200 meters and began attacking
shore installations. Antiaircraft
fire hardly seemed to hinder them as
they “worked things over a bit” and
gave embattled defenders their first
taste of dive-bombing. <i>Soryu</i>’s and
<i>Hiryu</i>’s aviators, having experienced
the flak over Pearl Harbor, reported
“very slight” resistance from antiaircraft
fire. “The enemy,” Rear Admiral
Abe reflected, “seemed to lose their
fighting spirits.”</p>

<p>The blow had fallen without
warning. It caught Second Lieutenant
Kliewer eating breakfast with the
crews of the two .50-caliber machine
guns at the west end of the field. He
admired them for the way in which
they stuck to their guns amidst the
bombing and strafing, continuing to
fire “when other guns on the island
[had been] silenced.”</p>

<p>The raid had caught Major Putnam
returning from Camp 2 in a
truck. He attempted to reach the only
flyable F4F, but strafing Zeroes twice
forced him away. Only after the Mitsubishis
and Aichis left the vicinity,
at about 1020, was he able to take off
and attempt to follow them to their
ships. Although he was not successful
in that endeavor, his attempt typified
the “highest order of courage and
resolution” that he displayed
throughout the siege. As Putnam
searched for the Japanese fleet, Cunningham
radioed word of the morning’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
raid to CinCPac and the
Commandant of the 14th Naval
District.</p>

<p>Later that day, 33 Nells paid Wake
a visit. The antiaircraft fire, however,
apparently forced them to bomb
from a higher altitude than before
(18,000 feet <i>vice</i> 13,000). Although
Dan Godbold claimed to have seen
one plane dropping from the skies
over Wake, trailing smoke, all
G3M2s returned safely to Roi. Their
bombs, however, had fallen thickly
about the battery, scoring a bullseye
on the director emplacement, killing
Platoon Sergeant Johnalson E.
Wright, wounding three other men,
and knocking unconscious the range
officer, Second Lieutenant Robert W.
Greeley. The M-4 director, although
destroyed by the bomb, deflected the
full force of the explosion from Greeley
and saved his life.</p>

<p>Wright, the firing battery officer,
had been known for his cheerfulness
and boundless vitality. Although
during previous raids he had been
told to take cover, he had remained
at his post, calmly giving orders and
disregarding the bombs. His seemingly
tireless efforts to improve the
efficiency of the battery earned him
a Bronze Star posthumously.</p>

<p>At Peacock Point, a bomb had
fallen near the shelter belonging to
Barninger’s no. 2 gun crew, causing
the entrance to be blocked and blowing
the sides in. Fortunately, no one
was hurt. “The bomb hitting the
shelter,” Barninger wrote later, “was
the only one close to the guns.” He
and his men spent the rest of the day
repairing the damaged shelter. Most
of the Marines, though, began feeling
that foxholes were better. “Although
we didn’t lose a man,” Barninger commented,
“it was a close thing and
with the heavy caliber bombs the
shelter is too light. For that reason we
are all back in the foxholes.”</p>

<p>On the previous day, Major Devereux
had ordered Marine Gunner
McKinstry to keep the two guns of
Battery F firing to divert the enemy’s
attention from the only complete battery
on the island, Battery E. On the
22d, McKinstry’s gunners put on a
fine performance, despite having
neither director nor heightfinder to
help them. Firing by the expedient of
“lead ’em a mile,” the two guns of Battery
F kept the enemy guessing as to
which group of guns was the greater
threat.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all of the planes from
<i>Hiryu</i> and <i>Soryu</i> returned undamaged
to their decks. Then, Abe’s
force steamed south to be in a position
200 miles from Wake the next
day to provide an antisubmarine
screen for Kajioka’s ships.</p>

<p>At Pearl Harbor, Vice Admiral Pye
read with concern Cunningham’s dispatch
reporting the raid by carrier
planes. The Japanese had inserted a
dangerous new factor into the equation.
Pye deemed it essential “to insure
[the] defense of the [Hawaiian]
islands.” With the Army’s Hawaiian
defense in shambles, and the battleship
strength significantly reduced by
the Japanese attack on 7 December,
he believed that the Pacific Fleet’s
three carriers constituted the best
protection for Oahu. After he considered
the evidence of increased
Japanese air activity in the Marshalls,
with one, or perhaps two, carrier
groups in that vicinity, as well as “evidence
of extensive offshore lookout
and patrol,” he decided that a surprise
raid on Jaluit could not be conducted
successfully. Thus, Pye reluctantly
abandoned the proposed carrier
raid on the Marshalls.</p>

<p>While he allowed the efforts to
relieve Wake to continue, Pye warned
Fletcher not to get within 200 miles
of the atoll, and directed Brown to
move north with Task Force 11 to
support Task Force 14. That decided,
on the afternoon of 20 December,
he radioed his decision to the
Navy Department.</p>

<p>With efforts to relieve Wake
progressing, CinCPac radioed Cunningham
on the morning of the 22d
(21st at Pearl Harbor) and asked him
to report the condition of the aircraft
runways. He also requested to be informed
immediately of any significant
developments.</p>

<p>At 0800 on 22 December, 39 planes
from the <i>Soryu</i> and the <i>Hiryu</i>
ascended and headed into the gray
skies above the beleaguered atoll.
Their pilots expected to meet American
fighters.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant Davidson took
off from Wake at 1000, cranked up
his landing gear, and set out on the
regular midday patrol. Engine trouble
prevented Captain Freuler from
getting aloft until 1030.</p>

<p>Shortly before noon, Davidson,
patrolling to the north of Wake, radioed
Freuler, then flying to the south
of the atoll, informing him of approaching
enemy aircraft. In spite of
the odds, both men gave battle.</p>

1931. He was awarded a Navy Cross and
a Bronze Star for heroism at Wake.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Freuler engaged six carrier attack
planes and dropped one, trailing
smoke, out of formation on his first
pass. As the group of Nakajimas
broke up, he made an opposite approach
and fired, flaming one Kate,
which exploded in an expanding ball
of fire about 50 feet beneath him. As
his controls responded sluggishly,
and his badly scorched F4F’s
manifold pressure dropped, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
glanced back toward Wake and saw
Davidson engaging several enemy
planes. An instant later, a <i>Hiryu</i> Zero
got on Freuler’s tail and opened fire.
Bullets penetrated Freuler’s fuselage,
both sides of his vacuum tank, the
bulkhead, seat, and parachute. After
his plane was hit, Freuler threw
his F4F into a steep dive&mdash;the
Japanese pilot did not follow him&mdash;nursed
it home, and landed with the
canopy stuck in the closed position.
Ground crews extricated him and
took him to the hospital.</p>

<p>Carl Davidson, unfortunately, did
not return. The pilot who had
knocked Freuler out of the fight went
to the rescue of his shipmates and
shot down Davidson. Rear Admiral
Abe later paid homage to the two
Marine pilots who had challenged his
carrier planes, lauding them as having
resisted fiercely and bravely.</p>

<p>The <i>Soryu</i> lost two planes and
their three-man crews. Damage
suffered in the aerial action compelled
a third to ditch, but one of the
screening ships recovered its crew.</p>

<p>That afternoon, at 1320, Cunningham
radioed Pye that a “combined
land- and carrier-based plane attack”
had occurred and that his fighters
had engaged the attackers. He reported
Davidson’s loss and the wounding
of Freuler, but noted that they
had shot down “several” planes. The
atoll had suffered “no further
damage.” As “Barney” Barninger later
recounted: “Dive bombers again&mdash;the
carriers must still be in the vicinity....
Things are getting tense.
Rumor continues to fly about relief,
but the dive bombers [are] also
present. Things go on in the same
manner as before. All that can be
done is being done, but there is so
little to do [it] with.”</p>

<p>Heavy seas bedevilled Frank Jack
Fletcher’s Task Force 14 as it pressed
westward. Having been ordered to
fuel to capacity before fighting,
Fletcher began fueling his ships from
<i>Neches</i> in the turbulent seas. Rolling
swells and gusty winds slowed that
process considerably and permitted
the fueling of only four of his destroyers.
If Fletcher was expected to
fight, his ships would require more
fuel to be able to maneuver at high
speed, if necessary. He resolved to top
off the rest the following day (23 December).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at around 1900 on 21
December (1530, 22 December
Wake), the PBY that had borne
Major Bayler (the “last man off Wake
Island”) from Wake to Midway arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
at Pearl Harbor. The plane’s
commander dictated a report, which
was transcribed by a CinCPac stenographer
shortly after the pilot’s arrival,
regarding Wake’s desperate
plight. Pye, upon reading the report,
was deeply moved. Members of Pye’s
staff, many of whom had also faithfully
served on Admiral Kimmel’s
staff, pleaded with Pye’s Chief of
Staff, Rear Admiral Milo F. Draemel,
on behalf of the Wake relief efforts.
Referring to the PBY commander’s
report, Pye declared later, “the situation
at Wake seemed to warrant taking
a greater chance to effect its
reinforcement even at the sacrifice of
the <i>Tangier</i> and possible damage to
some major ships of Task Force 14.”
The admiral therefore removed the
restrictions on Task Force 14’s operations.
The <i>Tangier</i> was to be
detached with two destroyers to run
in to Wake to begin the evacuation
of the civilians and to disembark the
Marines.</p>

<p><i>The sound of the heavy surf surging ashore continuously in the
defenders’ ears as it pounded the reef that ringed the atoll, militated
against their hearing approaching enemy planes&mdash;a
decided disadvantage in view of Wake’s lack of radar.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Pye also rescinded the restrictions
on the operating areas of Task Forces
8 and 11, allowing them to support
Cunningham’s command more effectively.
Those on the staff who had
pleaded for the relief force to continue
toward Wake felt vindicated by
Pye’s decision that night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at Wake, with Commander
Cunningham’s prior approval,
Paul Putnam, with no flyable
planes left, reported his men to
Major Devereux for service as infantrymen.
Devereux ordered Putnam to
keep his squadron where it was and
await further orders.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="This_Is_As_Far_As_We_Go" id="This_Is_As_Far_As_We_Go"></a>‘<i>This Is As Far As We Go</i>’</h2>

<p>Shortly after midnight, First Lieutenant
Barninger noted flashing lights
“way off the windy side of the island.”
Alerted to the odd display on the
horizon in the darkness, Barninger
telephoned Major Devereux, who replied
that he also had seen it. Devereux
directed Barninger to keep a
watch out and cautioned the Peacock
Point strongpoint commander to be
mindful that the lee shore posed the
most possibilities for danger. Lookouts
continued to note irregular
flashes of light in the black, gusty,
rainy predawn of 23 December 1941.
It may have been the <i>Tenryu</i>, the <i>Tatsuta</i>,
and the <i>Yubari</i> firing blindly at
what their spotters thought was
Wake Island but which was, instead,
only empty ocean.</p>

<p>At 0145, however, a report came
into the detachment commander’s
command post, telling of an enemy
landing in progress at Toki Point, at
the tip of Peale. Devereux alerted the
battalion. Kessler, in the meantime,
dispatched a patrol up the lagoon
beach toward the PanAm facility,
which met a patrol from Battery D.
Neither had anything to report. On
Wilkes, Captain Platt directed Battery
L to move the men of two 5-inch
gun sections (equivalent to two rifle
squads) to the shore of the lagoon,
west of the area of the new channel
being dredged across the island. The
rest of the men of the battery&mdash;fire
controlmen and headquarters men
under McAlister, who had established
his command post near the
searchlight section of the battery&mdash;moved
into positions they had
readied along the south shore of
Wilkes, between McKinstry’s Battery
F and the new channel.</p>

<p>Kessler, whom Devereux had requested
to confirm or deny the accuracy
of the information regarding
the landing, reported that there was
no landing in progress, but that he
had seen the lights offshore. Cunningham,
at 0145, radioed the Commandant,
14th Naval District, reporting
“gunfire between ships to northeast
of island.”</p>

<p>Wake thus alerted, Second Lieutenant
Arthur A. Poindexter, at
Camp 1 with the mobile reserve
(predominantly supply and administration
Marines and 15 sailors under
Boatswain’s Mate First Class James E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Barnes), believed Peale to be threatened.
He exercised initiative and entrucked
eight Marines and with four
.30-caliber machine guns. Reporting
his intention to the detachment commander,
Poindexter and that portion
of his mobile reserve sped past the
airfield toward Peale. It was nearing
Devereux’s command post when he
ordered it intercepted. The major retained
Poindexter’s little force where
it was, pending clarification of the
situation.</p>

<p>The bad weather that prevented
the Marines from seeing their foes
likewise hindered the Japanese.
Shortly before 0200, <i>Special Naval
Landing Force</i> troops clambered
down into the medium landing craft
designated to land on Wilkes and
Wake. Four landing craft were
launched some 3,000 to 4,000 meters
offshore, but in the squalls and long
swells they experienced difficulty
keeping up with <i>Patrol Boat No. 32</i>
and <i>Patrol Boat No. 33</i> as they
churned on a northeasterly course,
headed for the beach. The landing
craft designated to follow <i>No. 32</i> lost
sight of her in the murky, gusty
darkness.</p>

<p>At about 0230, Marines on Peacock
Point detected the two patrol
boats, which appeared to them only
as dark shapes as they made for the
reef by the airstrip. Then, the two
ships ground gently ashore on the
coral. The Japanese naval infantrymen
slipped over the side into the
surf, struggled ashore, and sprinted
across the coral for cover.</p>

<p>On Wilkes, Gunner McKinstry
called to Captain Platt and informed
him that he thought he heard the
sound of engines over the boom of
the surf, and at 0235 one of his
.50-caliber guns (gun no. 10) opened
fire in the darkness. Ten minutes
later, McKinstry, having sought permission
to use illumination, caused
a searchlight to be turned on.
Although the light was shut off as
suddenly as it had been turned on,
its momentary beam revealed a landing
boat aground on Wilkes’ rocky
shore and, beyond that, two destroyers,
beached on Wake.</p>

<p><i>1stLt Arthur A. Poindexter (seen here
in a post-war photograph), commander
of the mobile reserve on Wake, provided
such evidence of “exemplary conduct
and ability to lead troops ... with utter
disregard for his own safety” that he was
ultimately awarded the Bronze Star.</i></p></div></div>

<p>McAlister ordered Platoon Sergeant
Henry A. Bedell to detail two
men to hurl grenades into the enemy
craft. The veteran non-commissioned
officer, accompanied only by Private
First Class William F. Buehler, gamely
tackled the task, but Japanese gunfire
killed Bedell and wounded
Buehler before either had been able
to work their way close enough to
lob grenades into the boats.</p>

<p>McKinstry’s men, meanwhile,
manned the 3-inchers of Battery F,
but the guns could not be depressed
enough to fire onto the beach. The
Marines held their position until the
men from the <i>Takano Unit</i> of the
<i>Special Naval Landing Force</i> approached
closely enough to begin
lobbing grenades. Marines and
Japanese grappled in the darkness,
hand-to-hand, before McKinstry’s
men, after removing the firing locks
from the guns, pulled back to take up
infantry positions. Their concentrated
fires kept most of the Japanese at
bay near the 3-inch gun position.</p>

<p>Other <i>Special Naval Landing Force</i>
troops, however, probed westward,
toward the 5-inch guns that had so
humbled Kajioka’s force on the 11th.
They ran into heavy fire from gun
no. 9, a well-camouflaged .50-caliber
Browning, handled skillfully by
20-year old Private First Class Sanford
K. Ray and situated some 75
yards west of where the <i>Takano Unit</i>
had first swarmed ashore. Ray’s fire
prevented the enemy from advancing
closer than 40 or 50 yards from his
sand-bagged position, and his proximity
to the beach allowed him not
only to harass the enemy but also to
report enemy movements. Although
Japanese troops had severed most
wire communication lines, Platt remained
in touch with developments
at the shoreline by reports from Ray.</p>

<p>Reports from observers along the
beach soon began to deluge Devereux’s
command post, where he
and his executive officer, Major Potter,
attempted to keep abreast of
events. Gunner Hamas relayed the
information to Cunningham, at his
command post. On the basis of those
reports, the island commander, at
0250, radioed the Commandant of
the 14th Naval District: “Island under
gunfire. Enemy apparently landing.”</p>

<p>At that point, Devereux directed
Poindexter to move the mobile
reserve into the area between Camp
1 and the west end of the airfield.
Since the eight Marines had remained
in the truck with the four machine
guns, only 15 minutes elapsed before
they set up both gun sections in a position
commanding the road that ran
along the south shore and also covering
a critical section of beach. Within
moments, Poindexter’s Brownings
chattered and spat into the dim shape
of the grounded <i>Patrol Boat No. 32</i>,
most of the bullets striking the after
part of the ship. <i>Special Naval Landing
Force</i> troops who disclosed their
positions by igniting flares soon came
under fire. At Camp 1, just up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
coast, men from Battery I and the
sailors who had been serving as lookouts
manned the four .30-caliber
machine guns set up there. From
Poindexter’s vantage point, the enemy
troops appeared confused and
disoriented, shouting and discharging
a number of flares, perhaps for
“control and coordination.”</p>

<p>Having received a report of
Japanese destroyers standing toward
Wake’s south shore (and well inside
the range of the 5-inch batteries that
had so vexed the enemy on 11 December),
Second Lieutenant Robert
M. Hanna, who commanded the
machine guns emplaced at the airstrip,
clearly perceived the threat. Accompanied
by Corporal Ralph J.
Holewinski and three civilians, Paul
Gay, Eric Lehtola, and Bob Bryan,
Hanna set off at a dead run for the
3-inch gun that had been emplaced
on the landward side of the beach
road, on a slight rise between the
beach road and the oiled tie-down
area at the airstrip. Up to that point,
Major Putnam’s grounded airmen,
their ground support unit, and the
volunteer civilians, had been awaiting
further orders. As Hanna and his
scratch 3-inch crew sprinted to the
then-unmanned gun, Devereux ordered
Putnam to support the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Putnam assigned Second Lieutenant
Kliewer to a post on the west end
of the airfield, along with Staff Sergeant
John F. Blandy, Sergeant
Robert E. Bourquin, Jr., and Corporal
Carroll E. Trego. They were to
set off the mines on the field if the
enemy attempted to use it. Two .50-caliber
guns situated just north of the
airstrip covered Kliewer’s position. At
the eastern end of the strip lay the
guns manned by Corporal Winford J.
McAnally, along with six Marines
and three civilians and supported by
a small group of riflemen. The gunners
enjoyed a perfect, unobstructed
field of fire&mdash;the airstrip itself.</p>

<p>About 0300, just at a time when
events began to develop with
startling rapidity as the Japanese
pushed ashore on Wilkes and Wake,
Major Devereux lost touch with
Camp 1, Putnam’s platoon, Hanna’s
command post near the airstrip, and
Barninger’s Battery A. Advancing
Japanese troops probably had found
the communication lines&mdash;the exigencies
of war had prevented them
from being buried&mdash;and cut them.
Devereux’s last situation reports from
those units painted a bleak picture.
If Cunningham received less-than-encouraging
reports from the defense
battalion commander, he received
equally grim news from CinCPac
when, at 0319 Wake time, Pearl Harbor
radioed to Wake that the <i>Triton</i>
and <i>Tambor</i> were returning to
Hawaiian waters. “No friendly vessels
should be in your vicinity today,”
the message stated, “Keep me informed.”</p>

<p>Hanna and his men, meanwhile,
reached the 3-inch gun and set to
work. Anxious hands fumbled in the
darkness for ammunition while
Hanna&mdash;since the gun lacked
sights&mdash;peered down the bore to
draw a bead on the beached and stationary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
<i>Patrol Boat No. 33</i> that lay
less than 500 yards away. The first
round tore into the ship’s bridge, seriously
wounding both the captain and
navigator, killing two seamen, and
wounding five. Hanna’s gun hurled
14 more rounds on target. Some of
his projectiles evidently touched off
a magazine, and the beached warship
began to burn. The illumination
provided by the burning ship revealed
her sistership, which Hanna
and his hard-working gunners bombarded,
as well. A short time later
three <i>Special Naval Landing Force</i>
sailors attacked Hanna’s exposed position.
In the ensuing fight, Hanna
cooly shot and killed all three enemy
sailors with his pistol and resumed
the operation of his 3-incher.</p>

<p>Reinforcing Hanna’s cannoneers
became the next order of business.
Devereux felt compelled to keep
Peale’s Battery B intact to deal with
surface threats, and Battery E (which,
by that point, had a full complement
of guns and crews along with the
only heightfinder and director) to
deal with enemy planes. That left
Godbold’s Battery D, which by that
point possessed only two operational
guns and no fire-control gear. Devereux
directed Godbold to send one
section (nine men) to the battalion
command post to reinforce Hanna’s
crew. Under Corporal Leon A.
Graves, the squad clambered on
board a contractor’s truck and
reached the command post about
0315. They were to proceed along the
road that paralleled the shoreline to
a junction some 600 yards south of
the airfield, where they were to leave
the truck and proceed through the
brush to Hanna’s position. Quickly,
they set out into the night.</p>

<p>The flames from the wrecked
<i>Patrol Boat No. 33</i> disclosed Japanese
troops advancing past the west end
of the airstrip into the thick undergrowth
in front of the mobile
reserve’s positions. Poindexter, after
ordering one machine gun section to
keep up a fire into the brush to interdict
that movement and protect his
own flank, heard machine gun fire
from Camp 1, behind him. Wanting
to see for himself if more Japanese
landing craft were coming ashore to
his rear, the lieutenant, accompanied
by his runner, left the front in charge
of Sergeant “QT” Wade, and hurried
back to the camp.</p>

<p>There, unable to see at what his
neophyte sailor-gunners were expending
their ammunition, Poindexter
asked each to point out his target.
Two could not&mdash;they’d opened fire
only because the other two had done
so&mdash;but a third pointed to the dim
outline of what appeared to be a
“large landing barge on the order of
a self-propelled artillery lighter.”
When another craft of the same type
seemed to materialize out of the
murk, Poindexter ordered firing resumed
at what proved to be two large
landing craft that were attempting to
ground themselves 1,200 yards east
of the entrance to Wilkes Channel.</p>

<p>The enemy coxswains, however,
appeared to be having difficulty
coaxing the unwieldy landing craft
onto the beach, backing off and trying
again and again to land the <i>Special
Naval Landing Force</i> men
crouched behind the gunwales,
which seemed to be deflecting the
.30-caliber bullets peppering them.
Seizing the moment, Poindexter
called for volunteers to pick their way
down the rocky beach to the water’s
edge, there to lob grenades into the
boats. Poindexter organized two
teams&mdash;Mess Sergeant Gerald Carr
and a civilian, Raymond R. “Cap”
Rutledge (who had served in the
Army in France in World War I), in
one, Poindexter and Boatswain’s
Mate First Class Barnes in the other.
The grenadiers dashed to the water’s
edge while the machine guns momentarily
held their fire. Barnes, taking
cover behind coral heads, remained
hidden until the barges
ground ashore again. Then, exposing
himself to enemy fire, he hurled
several grenades toward the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
craft, and managed to land at least
one inside, killing or wounding many
of the troops on board.</p>

<p>The valiant efforts of Poindexter
and his men, however, stopped the
Japanese just momentarily, for soon
they began swarming ashore and
moving inland. Shortly before the
wire communications to Devereux’s
command post failed, Poindexter
reported the result of his foray.</p>

<p>Having seen flares streaking skyward
in the murk, Captain Godbold
on Peale, meanwhile, sent out two
patrols, one to move westward
toward the naval air base, and the
other to go eastward along the lagoon’s
shore. Neither patrol encountered
any enemy troops. A half-hour
later, Godbold established an outpost
at the bridge connecting Peale and
Wake.</p>

<p>JAPANESE LANDING ON WILKES<br />

<span class="smaller">0300, 23 DECEMBER, 1941</span></p></div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, after word of the enemy
landing reached Pearl Harbor,
Vice Admiral Pye convened a meeting
of his staff. By 0700 (22 December,
Hawaiian time), having received
further word of developments at
Wake, Pye estimated that a relief of
the island looked impossible, given
the prevailing situation, and directed
that the <i>Tangier</i> should be diverted
toward the east. With the relief mission
abandoned, should his forces attack
the enemy forces in the vicinity
of Wake? Or should American forces
be withdrawn to the east? He feared
that the timing of the Japanese carrier
strikes and the landing then in
progress indicated that the enemy
had “estimated closely the time at
which our relief expedition might arrive
and may, if the general location
of our carrier groups is estimated, be
waiting in force.” American forces
could inflict extensive damage upon
Japanese, Pye believed, if the enemy
did not know of the presence of the
U.S. carrier task forces. They had not
yet seen action, though, and no one
could overestimate the danger of having
ships damaged 2,000 miles from
the nearest repair facilities&mdash;“a
damaged ship is a lost ship,” Brown
had commented in Task Force 11’s
war diary. Damage to the carriers
could leave the Hawaiian Islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
open to a major enemy thrust. “We
cannot,” Pye declared, “afford such
losses at present.”</p>

<p>Two courses of action existed&mdash;to
direct Task Force 14 to attack
Japanese forces in the vicinity of
Wake, with Task Forces 8 and 11
covering Task Force 14’s retirement,
or to retire all forces without any attempt
to attack the enemy. These
choices weighed heavily on Pye’s
mind. If American forces hit the
Japanese ships at Wake and suffered
the loss of a carrier air group in the
process, Pye deemed the “offensive
spirit” shown by the Navy as perhaps
worth the sacrifice.</p>

<p>However, in the midst of his
deliberations, shortly after 0736, Pye
received a message from the CNO
which noted that recent developments
had emphasized that Wake
was a “liability” and authorized Pye
to “evacuate Wake with appropriate
demolition.” With Japanese forces on
the island, though, Pye felt that
capitulation was only a matter of
time. “The real question at issue,” Pye
thought, “is, shall we take the chance
of the loss of a carrier group to attempt
to attack the enemy forces in
the vicinity of Wake?” Radio intelligence
from the previous day linked
“CruDiv 8 ... CarDiv 2” and, erroneously,
“BatDiv 3” (consisting of
two battleships) with the forces off
of Wake. A pair of <i>Kongo</i>-class fast
battleships, supported by carriers and
heavy cruisers would easily have
overmatched Fletcher’s Task Force 14.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Japanese cruisers&mdash;probably
the <i>Yubari</i>, <i>Tenryu</i>, and
<i>Tatsuta</i>&mdash;had begun shelling Wake,
further discomfitting the defenders.
Despite Lewis’ Battery E firing “prearranged
3-inch air burst concentrations”
over the Japanese beachhead,
the enemy continued to press steadily
toward VMF-211’s position around
Hanna’s 3-inch gun. Major Putnam,
already wounded in the jaw, with
blood from his wound staining the
backs of the snapshots of his little
daughters, which he carried in his
pocket, formed his final line. “This,”
he said, “is as far as we go.”</p>

Japanese landing barges off Wake in the
pre-dawn fighting of 23 December.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Putnam had placed Captain Elrod
in command of one flank of
VMF-211’s defensive line, which was
situated in dense undergrowth. In the
impenetrable darkness, the squadron
executive officer and his men&mdash;most
of whom were unarmed civilians
who acted as weapons and ammunition
carriers (until weapons became
available)&mdash;conducted a spirited
defense which repeated attacks by
<i>Special Naval Landing Force</i> troops
could not dislodge. Each time he
heard Japanese troops mounting a
probe of 211’s position, Elrod interposed
himself between the enemy
and his own men and provided
covering fire to enable his detachment
to keep supplied with guns and
ammunition. Shortly before dawn,
a Japanese sailor who had hidden
himself among the heaps of casualties
surrounding Hanna’s gun shot
and killed the gallant Captain Elrod.</p>

<p>Captain Tharin, in charge of a
group of Marines on the left flank of
VMF-211’s line, delivered covering
fire for the unarmed ammunition carriers
attached to his unit, which
repulsed several assaults on his position.
At one point, Japanese sailors
penetrated the defenses in Tharin’s
sector, but in the counterattack,
which drove the enemy from the position,
Tharin captured an enemy automatic
weapon and used it “successfully
and effectively against its former
owners.” The indomitable Aviation
Machinist’s Mate First Class Hesson
armed himself with a Thompson
sub-machine gun and some grenades
and although wounded by rifle fire
and grenade fragments, single-handedly
drove back two concerted
attacks&mdash;killing several Japanese and
preventing them from overrunning
211’s flank.</p>

<p>Despite the heroic efforts of Putnam’s
“platoon,” the Japanese
managed to move into the roughly
triangular area which was bounded
by Peacock Point, on one side, the
beach and the south side of the airstrip
on the others. Corporal Graves’
squad from Battery D, meanwhile,
detrucked somewhat north of their
intended destination (200 yards south
of the airstrip rather than 600), began
walking toward VMF-211’s position,
and quickly encountered a
Japanese patrol. In the ensuing fire-fight,
enemy machine gun and rifle
fire killed one Marine and pinned
down the remainder for a time, until
Graves and his men managed to
extricate themselves and retire northward
toward the battalion command
post. Graves’ encounter indicated that
the Japanese had penetrated the U.S.
defenses. Despite their extraordinary
efforts, neither Kliewer and the
.50-caliber guns at the airfield, nor
the Hanna-VMF-211 group at the
3-inch gun near the shore, had been
able to stop them.</p>

<p>At the same time, Batteries A and
E began to receive mortar, small
arms, and machine gun fire, prompting
Barninger to deploy his range section,
armed with two .30-caliber
Brownings, and deployed as infantrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
facing northwest “across the
high ground” to the rear of the
5-inchers at Peacock Point. Lewis,
whose 3-inch fire had silenced an automatic
weapons position in the
thick undergrowth southwest of Battery
E, dispatched a patrol to try to
relieve the pressure on his position.
That group, under Sergeant Raymond
Gragg, progressed only 50
yards beyond the perimeter before it
came under heavy fire. The Japanese,
however, moved no further because
of the resistance put up by Gragg’s
squad.</p>

<p>U. S. COUNTERATTACK ON WILKES<br />

<span class="smaller">DAYBREAK, 23 DECEMBER 1941</span></p></div></div>

<p>Amidst the chaos, Devereux
groped for information about the
progress of the battle. At some point,
he received word from one of the few
positions which had retained wire
contact with his command post, Corporal
McAnally’s machine gun section,
which was located at the eastern
end of the airstrip. McAnally reported
that the Japanese were advancing
up the shore road, apparently intent
upon launching a thrust up the other
prong of Wake. With one unit besetting
Putnam’s at the airstrip, another
Japanese unit skirted Putnam and
Hanna and was headed into the triangular
end of Peacock Point.</p>

<p>McAnally, establishing contact
with the .50-caliber machine guns on
the east shore of Wake, some 400
yards south, carried on a “resolute,
well-coordinated defense” which
stymied the enemy in the area. Perhaps
more important, McAnally
served as Devereux’s eyes and ears on
that portion of the battlefield.</p>

<p>On Wilkes, Private First Class
Ray’s defense of his position equalled
that of McAnally’s. Captain Platt,
having lost communication with his
own posts and also with the defense
battalion command post, set out on
a personal reconnaissance mission at
about 0430. He crawled through the
thick underbrush and picked his way
across the rocky beach, until, at
about 0500, he came to a place east
of gun no. 10 where he could see <i>Special
Naval Landing Force</i> men massed
in and about Battery F’s guns. Soon
thereafter, while clambering back to
the gun, Platt met Sergeant Raymond
L. Coulson and ordered him
to gather two .30-caliber machine gun
crews and their guns at Kuku Point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
(where they had been sent during the
false alarm earlier that morning),
along with the searchlight crew and
everyone else he could find, and to
return to gun no. 10.</p>

<p>Devereux, still isolated from his
units and literally in the dark about
the actions on Wilkes and those in
the vicinity of Camp 1, attempted as
best he could to keep the island commander
informed. Cunningham,
consequently, also had scant comprehension
of the way the fighting was
progressing in those areas. At 0500,
about the time Captain Platt was reconnoitering
the Japanese position on
Wilkes, Cunningham radioed Commandant
14th Naval District, “Enemy
on island. Issue in doubt.”</p>

<p>Poindexter, meanwhile, satisfied
that Camp 1 was being defended as
well as possible, proceeded to the
mobile reserve gun positions on the
west side of the airfield. Japanese
machine gun and mortar fire, accompanied
by “much shouting” and
“numerous pyrotechnic flares,” began
to fall around those positions, partially
disabling one U.S. gun section.
As the sky over Wake began to lighten
with the dawn, Poindexter became
concerned about the enemy fire that
had begun to land near his men, and
also that the enemy troops infiltrating
the woods might outflank the
mobile reserve. He ordered a retirement
toward Camp 1. The sections
alternated in covering each other
throughout the movement, maintaining
a steady volume of fire. Reaching
Camp 1 after daylight,
Poindexter established a north-south
line astride the shore road, east of a
prominent water tank.</p>

<p>While Poindexter deliberated the
situation facing his force, Japanese
movement along the east shore road
increasingly pressed Corporal
McAnally’s group. McAnally communicated
his difficult situation to
Devereux’s command post. Japanese
hand grenades and small arms fire
made life difficult for McAnally’s
band, which nevertheless held its
ground and broke up several assaults.</p>

<p>Around 0530, Devereux told
Major Potter to form a final defensive
line astride the north-south road,
which was being threatened from the
south by the advancing Japanese.
Calling Godbold’s Battery D into the
action soon thereafter, Devereux
committed his last reserve troops into
the action on the east side of Wake.
Aware of Corporal McAnally’s predicament,
Devereux ordered the corporal’s
combat group to withdraw
northward, toward the command
post, to join Major Potter’s
detachment.</p>

<p>On Wilkes at about that time, Sergeant
Coulson rejoined Captain Platt
with the two machine gun crews and
guns, and eight riflemen. The surf
that had masked the sound made by
the invaders now worked to the advantage
of the hard-pressed defenders.
Along with the sputter and
crackle of gunfire along the south
shore of Wake and on Wilkes, it prevented
the Japanese from discovering
Platt’s briefing of his Marines for the
assault on the abandoned Battery F
position. In the waning darkness,
Platt and his men crept toward the
enemy, reaching a point less than 50
yards away from the abandoned
3-inchers. On Platt’s signal, the two
machine guns chattered and spat
toward the enemy position. His skirmishers
charged forward and soon
began engaging the Japanese&mdash;who,
with no security on the west, were
taken completely by surprise, and
whose only light machine guns had
been emplaced facing eastward,
toward the old channel.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with Platt’s
assault, but not at all coordinated
with it, McAlister (who lost contact
with the Wilkes strongpoint commander
soon after the enemy landing)
and his men encountered and
engaged a small enemy patrol on the
beach ahead of them, killing one
man before the rest took cover behind
some coral boulders. While
flanking fire pinned down the enemy,
Gunner McKinstry started forward
to clean out that pocket of resistance.
McAlister stopped him, but as he was
telling the Gunner to detail one of the
men to do it instead, Corporal William
C. Halstead climbed atop the
rocks and slew the remainder of the
enemy.</p>

<p>Platt’s and McAlister’s assaults
cleaned out the Japanese in the 3-inch
gun position. Platt and McAlister reorganized
their units and searched
for any enemy troops who might
have escaped. They encountered no
further resistance and took two
prisoners, who had been wounded
and had feigned death. The Marines
counted at least 94 dead Japanese.
American losses included nine Marines
and two civilians killed; four
Marines and one civilian wounded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile (shortly before dawn)
on Wake, Japanese troops surrounded
Kliewer’s position. The four Marines,
however, armed with only two
Thompsons, three .45-caliber pistols,
and two boxes of hand grenades,
repelled multiple bayonet charges in
the darkness. Dawn revealed a full-scale
enemy attempt to carry the
post, but Kliewer and his three shipmates,
backed up by the two .50-caliber
machine guns 150 yards behind
them, killed many of the attacking
Japanese and continued to hold
their ground.</p>

<p>On Peale, with the departure of
Captain Godbold and the Marines of
Battery D for the island’s command
post on Wake, First Lieutenant Kessler
became strongpoint commander.
At dawn, he scanned the other islets.
On Wilkes, he discerned Japanese
flags whipping in the breeze&mdash;one
particularly large one flying where
Battery F had been (flags which
Platt’s men would remove shortly
thereafter). Kessler reported his observations
to Devereux, who had not
heard a word from Platt since around
0300. The report prompted Devereux
to fear that Wilkes had fallen.</p>

<p>As he scanned Wake at about
0600, however, Kessler observed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
masts of what proved to be <i>Patrol
Boat No. 32</i>, which was aground on
the south shore of Wake. Kessler requested
permission to fire at the ship.
His request was approved, but he
was admonished to avoid firing into
friendly troops. Kessler ordered his
5-inchers to open fire. The first salvo
clipped off the mainmast. Then Battery
B’s gunners lowered their sights
to hit the ship itself. They could see
only the funnel tops over the intervening
island. Twenty-five minutes
later, at 0625, the command post ordered
Battery B to cease fire, their
target having been “demolished.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, Kessler observed
four “battleships, or super
heavy cruisers” (probably the heavy
cruisers <i>Aoba</i>, <i>Kinugasa</i>, <i>Furutaka</i>,
and <i>Kako</i>) off Heel Point, moving
westward but remaining well out of
range. Those ships lay 10 kilometers
offshore and shelled the atoll, but
achieved little success.</p>

<p>Additional Japanese forces were
headed for Wake. At 0612, off to the
northwest, <i>Soryu</i> turned into the
wind and launched 12 planes. The
day’s air operations had begun. In
less than an hour, the planes were
over the island.</p>

<p>Throughout the battle, Major Devereux
had, as well as he could, kept
the island commander informed of
the progress of the assault. While the
Marines, assisted by the sailors and
civilians, had been attempting to
stem the tide, most of the news which
trickled into Cunningham’s command
post boded ill. At 0652, he sent
out a message reflecting the situation
as he knew it: “Enemy on island.
Several ships plus transport moving
in. Two DD aground.” That was at
1032, 22 December 1941, on Pearl
Harbor. It was to be the last message
from the Wake Island defenders.</p>

<p>At Pearl Harbor, at about the time
that Cunningham was sending that
last message, Vice Admiral Pye had
reached making a decision. He concluded
that if Task Force 14 encountered
anything but a weaker Japanese
force, the battle would be fought on
Japanese terms while within range of
shore-based planes and with American
forces having only enough fuel
for two days of high speed steaming.
Like Brown, Pye believed that a
damaged ship was a lost ship, especially
2,000 miles from Pearl Harbor.
The risk, he believed, was too great.
He ordered the recall of Task Forces
14 and 11, and directed Task Force 8
to cover the retirement.</p>

<p>Frank Jack Fletcher’s Task Force 14,
meanwhile, was right on schedule,
and was in fact further west than Pye
knew. His ships fully fueled and
ready for battle, Fletcher planned to
detach the <i>Tangier</i> and two destroyers
for the final run-in to Wake, while
the pilots on board the <i>Saratoga</i> prepared
themselves for the fight ahead.
Fletcher, not one to shirk a fight,
received the news of the recall angrily.
He ripped his hat from his head
and disgustedly hurled it to the deck.
Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch,
Fletcher’s air commander, similarly
felt the fist-tightening frustration of
the recall. He retired from the <i>Saratoga</i>’s
flag bridge as the talk there
reached “mutinous” proportions.</p>

<p>As word of the recall circulated
throughout Task Force 14, reactions
were pretty much the same. Pye’s
recall order left no latitude for discussion
or disobedience; those who
argued later that Fletcher should have
used the Nelsonian “blind eye” obviously
failed to recognize that, in the
sea off Copenhagen, the British admiral
could see his opponents. Fletcher
and Fitch, then 430 miles east of
Wake, could not see theirs. They had
no idea what enemy forces they
might encounter. The Japanese had
beaten them to Wake.</p>

<h2><a name="A_Difficult_Thing_To_Do" id="A_Difficult_Thing_To_Do"></a>‘<i>A Difficult Thing To Do</i>’</h2>

<p>Even as deliberations proceeded to
determine the fate of the relief efforts,
the men on Wake, ignorant of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
was transpiring at Pearl Harbor and
on the bridges of Task Force 14’s
ships, fought on. Shortly before 0700
on Wake (1040, 22 December, at
Pearl Harbor), the two trucks bearing
Battery D’s former antiaircraft
gunners, under Second Lieutenant
Greeley and Captain Godbold,
respectively, reached Devereux’s command
post. Major Potter deployed
the new arrivals in an attempt to
form a thin defensive line running
across the island. The attempt was
doomed because of the terrain they
were being forced to defend, an area
which had been partially cleared of
brush as part of the airfield construction.
It presented the Marines with
450 yards of ground without cover
or concealment. Marine Gunner
Borth established a defensive line
near the battalion command post
with two .30-caliber guns crewed by
command post Marines and a few
Marines from Battery D.</p>

<p>At about the time Greeley and
Godbold reached Devereux’s command
post with Battery D’s Marines,
Second Lieutenant Kessler, at Battery
B, shifted his attention to a column of
three destroyers off Kuku Point. Four
U.S. salvos appeared to inflict heavy
damage on the lead ship, so he shifted
his attention to the second ship in
column. After about 15 minutes, dive
bombers directed bombs and strafing
toward the position, the battery’s firing
having called attention to its existence.
Fortunately, their accuracy
was poor, and Kessler’s men escaped
without casualty.</p>

<p>By that time, the situation seemed
to be grim. Enemy planes were attacking
every visible target. Major
Potter’s final defense line was receiving
increasingly heavy enemy rifle
and machine gun fire. Japanese
troops near the airstrip continued
probing and besetting VMF-211’s encircled
remnant. Wilkes had apparently
fallen to the enemy. Major
Devereux saw little left to be done.
Still having no communication with
the stubborn defenders of Wilkes and
of Camp 1, Devereux had no way of
knowing which of his units were still
fighting.</p>

<p>About an hour after daylight
(0630), Commander Keene picked up
the telephone in the contractors’
headquarters and found Commander
Cunningham and Major Devereux
engaged in conversation on the line.
The latter reported being hard-pressed
at his command post. He did
not believe, he said, that the battalion
could hold out much longer.
Cunningham told Devereux that if he
did not feel he was able to continue
fighting, he should surrender. A discussion
between the two men then
ensued. “You know, Wilkes has
fallen,” Devereux stated. Cunningham
answered that he did. Devereux
then stated that he did not feel he
should make the decision to surrender,
that Cunningham, the commander
of the island, should decide.
Pausing for a moment, Cunningham
then told Devereux that he authorized
surrender, and to take the
necessary steps to carry it out. Uncertain
of his ability to contact the
Japanese commander, Devereux
asked Cunningham to attempt to
make contact with the enemy, as
well. Cunningham responded: “I’ll see
what I can do.”</p>

<p>Surrendering, however, would
take time, and the “word” did not
reach everyone right away. On
Wilkes, having reorganized his men,
Platt attempted at about 0800 to
phone the battalion command post
on Wake. He managed to reach
someone at the Camp 1 motor pool,
but got no farther, because the motor
pool was not in communication
with the command post.</p>

<p>At about 0800, Devereux notified
the units he could still reach of the
surrender decision. On Peale, Kessler
received orders to cease firing the
5-inch guns. At Battery E, Lewis’ men
removed and smashed the firing
locks. When stuffing blankets into
the muzzles and firing a round did
not do sufficient damage to the guns,
the men rolled grenades down the
barrels. Other Marines smashed
equipment and chopped up electrical
cables. Lewis himself destroyed the
optics and electromechanical parts of
the heightfinder and director by firing
20 rounds into them from his .45.
Satisfied with that work of destruction,
he marched his men as a unit
to Devereux’s command post. At Peacock
Point, First Lieutenant Barninger
ordered that the 5-inch firing
locks be broken and buried, the
telescopes smashed, and the rangekeeper
destroyed. Then, running up
a white flag, he ordered all hands, including
the civilians who had stood
faithfully with the battery, to eat as
much as they could. No one knew
how much the enemy would allow
their captives to eat.</p>

<p>As surrender preparations proceeded
apace on one side of Wake
and in the positions that Devereux
had been able to reach by telephone,
Poindexter’s men, meanwhile, established
themselves along a line at the
edge of the clearing east of Camp 1.
They emplaced 10 .30-caliber
machine guns to cover their entire
front with interlocking fields of fire.
Occasional low-flying planes strafed
their positions. Japanese gunfire from
their front, though, proved ineffective.
Poindexter sent back word to
Camp 1 for all “special duty personnel”
to join the reserve as riflemen.</p>

<p>When, by 0900, the enemy at the
front having shown no inclination to
attack his position, Poindexter ordered
a counterattack toward the airstrip.
Dividing his men into three
10-man squads with a non-commissioned
officer in charge of each, the
commander of the mobile reserve
decided to launch his attack along a
front which extended from the beach
into the brush on the north side of
the road. Poindexter’s counterattack
regained the terrain between Camp 1
and the road junction west of the
airstrip.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Devereux, accompanied
by Sergeant Donald Malleck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
who held aloft a white rag attached
to a swab handle, set out down the
north-south road along the eastern
shore of Wake to contact the Japanese.
As he passed Marines still in
action he ordered them to cease
firing.</p>

<p><i>Civilian contractors are marched off to captivity after the Japanese
captured Wake. Some, deemed important by the Japanese
to finish construction projects, were retained there. Fearing
a fifth column rising, the Japanese executed 98 contractors
in October 1943, an atrocity for which atoll commander,
RAdm Shigematsu Sakaibara, was hanged after the war.</i></p></div></div>

<p>A <i>Special Naval Landing Force</i>
sailor soon emerged from the brush
along the road and halted Devereux’s
progress, covering the major and Sergeant
Malleck as they took off their
helmets and laid down their
weapons. Unable to speak any English,
the Japanese motioned them
toward the hospital bunker, where
Devereux found an enemy officer
who spoke some English. The enemy
had already captured the hospital,
killing one patient and wounding
another when they fired into the entrance.
Soon thereafter, Commander
Cunningham, who had changed into
his blue uniform for the occasion, arrived
to arrange the details of the surrender.
Devereux and Malleck, accompanied
by a Japanese officer,
then began the sad journey toward
those Marines who still stubbornly
held out ahead of them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the resistance put up
by Hanna and the remnant of
VMF-211 had prompted the Japanese
to call for more close air support.
One plane overflew the embattled
3-inch gun and carried out low-level
attacks that allowed the observer to
fire on the position with his flexible-mount
7.7mm gun. The strafing
killed two civilians, Paul Gay and
Eric Bryan, and wounded Major Putnam,
Second Lieutenant Hanna, and
Corporal Holewinski.</p>

<p>Having finally reached the airfield
at around 0930, Devereux found that
the Japanese had taken cover behind
the revetments and had pinned down
Hanna’s men and what remained of
VMF-211’s force. The major ordered
Captain Tharin, the only officer who
had not been seriously wounded, to
cease fire. Of the 10 men in that position,
all&mdash;including the gallant Aviation
Machinist’s Mate First Class
Hesson&mdash;had been wounded in the
last-ditch fighting.</p>

<p>Even as elements on Wake still
held out, Vice Admiral Pye was informing
the CNO that Wake could
not be evacuated. Japanese forces had
landed, supported by cruisers and
destroyers and, probably, by a covering
force nearby. The “gallant defense
of Wake,” Pye stated, “has been of utmost
value, but hereafter Wake is a
liability.” In view of the “extensive
operations” then underway, the situation
had forced Pye to conclude
that risking one carrier task force to
attack enemy forces in the vicinity of
Wake was “not justifiable.” Pye had
ordered the two westernmost task
forces (14 and 11) to retire toward
Pearl Harbor. The third (Task Force
8) he sent on an unrelated mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
On Wake, Second Lieutenant
Kliewer, seeing the Japanese flags all
along the beach, decided to set off
the mines, blowing up the airfield,
and then to fall back in the confusion
generated by the explosions. Unfortunately,
the rain had drowned the
generator motor, which disabled the
electric detonator.</p>

<p>At 1015 Kliewer saw men carrying
a white flag coming down the beach.
Major Devereux was among them,
with a group of what appeared to be
Japanese officers. They stopped
about 50 feet from Kliewer’s trench
and ordered him to surrender. Kliewer’s
men counseled against giving up:
“Don’t surrender, lieutenant. The Marines
never surrender. It’s a hoax.”</p>

<p>“It was a difficult thing to do,”
Kliewer wrote later, “but we tore
down our guns and turned ourselves
over.”</p>

<p>About one hour later, Devereux’s
melancholy procession arrived at the
lines facing the mobile reserve, which
still fought stoutly. A rifleman shouted
back to Poindexter that a “large
group of Japs are coming down the
road toward us with a white flag.” As
they trudged closer, Poindexter could
see no Americans in the group, and
after ordering his men to hold their
fire, he stepped out into the road,
Springfield at the ready. Cautioning
his men not to fire unless the enemy
fired at him, he walked toward the
group. Soon, he discerned Major Devereux
amidst them, shouting to him,
telling him that Wake had been surrendered.</p>

<p>Dropping his rifle and grenades in
the road, Poindexter joined Devereux,
who then told him to return
to his unit and order his men to drop
their weapons and stand up. At that,
Japanese troops, bayonets fixed, began
to rush the positions they had
been engaging, but were stopped by
a Japanese officer who interposed
himself between the two sides. As
Poindexter and his men trudged
toward the airstrip, he saw large
numbers of enemy troops emerging
from the brush and falling in along
the road, confirming his suspicions
that the enemy had established itself
in force in the region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Devereux then progressed to Camp
1, which was still held by the
machine gun sections of Poindexter’s
group. There, a Japanese sailor
climbed to the top of the water tower
observation post and cut down the
stars and stripes that had been flying
throughout the battle. Elsewhere
at Camp 1, in what could be regarded
as one of the last measures of defiance
to the now-victorious foe,
Gunnery Sergeant John Cemeris, the
Wake detachment’s machine gun
maintenance sergeant, unaware of
the surrender, fired briefly at a low-flying
floatplane.</p>

<p>Cemeris was not alone in his defiance.
Marines on Wilkes, ignorant
that their shipmates on Wake and
Peale had laid down their arms, still
sought to carry on the fight as best
they could. Platt, sighting ships to the
southwest of Wilkes, ordered Battery
L to engage them. McAlister and his
men hurried back to the 5-inchers,
only to find the ships out of range.
Enduring bombing and strafing attacks
from Japanese planes, around
noon the Marines at Battery L spotted
small boats standing toward the
channel between Wilkes and Wake,
and observed several transports and
warships lying about 4,000 yards out.
Manning the 5-inchers, the Marines
discovered one would not move and
that one of the dive-bombing attacks
had damaged the recoil cylinders of
the other. Platt then ordered
McAlister’s Marines to take up a position
along the old channel and fire
on the small boats. An exploding
bomb killed 20-year-old Private First
Class Robert L. Stevens while the
men were en route to their new positions.
He was the last combat
casualty suffered by the Marines on
Wake Island.</p>

<p>At about 1300, Devereux reached
Wilkes. Soon thereafter, a Japanese
destroyer closed with the island and
opened fire, apparently intent on
bombarding them, but an exchange
of signals quickly caused the ship to
cease firing. Almost a half hour later,
at a point about between the old and
new channels, Devereux spotted “a
few grubby, dirty men [Piatt’s] who
came out of the brush with their rifles
ready.” They laid down their arms
and surrendered, too. The men of
Wake had fought well, impressing
the victors with their tenacious bravery,
which later proved to be inspiring,
not only to the Marine Corps,
but also to the nation as a whole.</p>

<p>Of the 449 Marines (1st Defense
Battalion and VMF-211 detachments)
who manned Wake’s defenses, 49
were killed, 32 were wounded, and
the remainder became prisoners of
war. Of the 68 Navy officers and
men, three were killed, five wounded,
and the rest taken prisoner. The
small, five-man Army communications
detachment suffered no fatalities;
they were all taken prisoner. Of
the 1,146 civilians involved in construction
programs on Wake Island,
70 were killed and 12 were wounded.
Five of Wake’s defenders were executed
by the Japanese on board <i>Nitta
Maru</i>. With the exception of nearly
100 contractors who remained on
Wake Island, all of the rest of the
civilians joined Wake’s Marines,
sailors, and soldiers in prisoner of
war (POW) camps. The Japanese
transported the wounded military
men and civilians from the island as
their wounds healed and they were
deemed well enough to travel. They,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
too, were placed in POW camps until
their liberation in 1945.</p>

<p>The Japanese lost two ships and
seven planes; a score more were
damaged. The casualty statistics,
though irrevocably incomplete, show
that at least 381 Japanese died and
many more were wounded.</p>

<p>Wake was not recaptured by
American forces during the war. Air
raids on Wake occurred throughout
the war, the first occurring in February
1942. Raids in October 1943,
however, had grave repercussions for
the contractors who had been left behind.
Rear Admiral Shigematsu
Sakaibara, the atoll commander,
who feared that the raids portended
a major landing, had them all executed.
He was unwilling to have his garrison
threatened by such a large “fifth
column.” For that offense, he was
hanged as a war criminal. The U.S.
recovered Wake Island after the
Japanese surrender in 1945.</p>

<p>Wake’s defense in 1941 had been
one of the few bright spots during the
first months of war in the Pacific. It
provided Americans a stirring example
of heroism.</p>
